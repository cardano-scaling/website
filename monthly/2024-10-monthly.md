This is a monthly report on the progress of üê≤ Hydra and üõ° Mithril projects since August 2024. This document serves as a preparation for and a written summary of the monthly stakeholder review meeting, which is announced on our Discord channels and held on Google Meet. This month, the meeting was held on 2024-10-23 using these [slides][slides] and [you can see the recording here][recording].

## Mithril

[Issues and pull requests closed in October](https://github.com/input-output-hk/mithril/issues?q=is%3Aclosed+sort%3Aupdated-desc+closed%3A2024-10-01..2024-10-31)

### Roadmap

Here‚Äôs the latest on our roadmap:

- **Cardano transactions signature/proving MVP** [#1457](https://github.com/input-output-hk/mithril/issues/1457): the feature has been activated on `mainnet`
- **Cardano stake distribution certification** [#955](https://github.com/input-output-hk/mithril/issues/955): the feature has been activated on `preview`, `preprod` and is pending activation on `mainnet`
- **Decentralization of signature orchestration** [#1777](https://github.com/input-output-hk/mithril/issues/1777): the feature has been activated on `preview`, `preprod` and `mainnet`
- **CIP for Mithril signature diffusion through the Cardano network** [#1775](https://github.com/input-output-hk/mithril/issues/1775): the draft CIP has received the number **CIP-0137** is at final review stage.
- **Protocol usage metrics/statistics** [#2028](https://github.com/input-output-hk/mithril/issues/2028): the feature is beeing implemented and will be released in November.

### Distributions

We released Mithril distribution [`2442.0`](https://github.com/input-output-hk/mithril/releases/tag/2442.0), which includes:

- Stable support for **decentralized signature orchestration**.
- Stable support for **Cardano transaction client library, CLI and WASM**.
- Stable support for new **Pythagoras** Mithril era.
- Bug fixes and performance improvements.

#### Future distributions

We plan to release new distributions in November:

- `2444`:
  - Stable clients for **Cardano stake distribution** certification.
  - Stable support for Prometheus metrics endpoint in aggregator.

### Dev blog

We have published the following post:

- [Certification of Cardano stake distribution](https://mithril.network/doc/dev-blog/2024/10/15/cardano-stake-distribution-certification)
- [Certification of Cardano transactions](https://mithril.network/doc/dev-blog/2024/07/30/cardano-transaction-certification) (Updated).

### Protocol status

### Decentralized Signature Orchestration

In order to get multiple aggreagators running on the same Mithril network, we need to **decentralize the signature orchestration** and make it happen independently on all the signers and aggregators.

We have implemented the feature which is now deployed on the `mainnet` with the signer released with the distribution [`2442.0`](https://github.com/input-output-hk/mithril/releases/tag/2442.0):

- The signer and aggregator nodes are able to compute independently the beacon which determines the messages to sign and certify.
- The aggregator does not advertise the pending certificates anymore (the pending certificate is deprecated. It is temporarily kept alive for legacy signer nodes and until sufficient adoption of the new version is reached).
- The aggregator buffers the individual signatures received from signers until it has computed the associated beacon, and it will try to aggregate them thereafter.

### Aggregator usage metrics and Grafana dashboard

We have been working a new Prometheus endpoint for the aggregator which provides detailed insights about the production of artifacts and certificates, the events received from the signers, and the artifacts and proofs served to the clients. The feature can be easily activated with some configuration parameters.

Additionally, we created a Grafana template to easily set up a dashboard for this Prometheus endpoint.

Notable updates on our [roadmap](https://github.com/orgs/cardano-scaling/projects/7/views/1) this month include:

### Aiken for Commit validator

We began porting our validators to Aiken, starting with the `Commit` validator. This resulted in saving of over 1Kb to the valdator script and increases the maximum number of head participants from 6 to 9.
