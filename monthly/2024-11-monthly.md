### Distributions

We released Mithril distribution [`2445.0`](https://github.com/input-output-hk/mithril/releases/tag/2445.0), which includes:

- üî• **Breaking changes in Mithril client library, CLI, and WASM** with removal of deprecated beacon in Mithril certificates.
- Stable support for **Cardano node** `10.1.2` in the signer and the aggregator.
- Stable support for **Cardano stake distribution client library, CLI and WASM**.
- Stable support for **Prometheus metrics** endpoint in aggregator.
- Bug fixes and performance improvements.

#### Future distributions

We plan to release new distributions in December:

- `2450`:
  - Availability of NodeJS and bundler targets in the Mithril client WASM npm package.
  - Stable support for **Cardano node** `10.1.3` in the signer and the aggregator.
  - Execution rights of pre-built binaries in the GitHub releases.

### Dev blog

We have published the following posts:

- [One line installer for Mithril binaries](https://mithril.network/doc/dev-blog/2024/11/25/one-line-binaries-installer)
- [New Protocol Insights Dashboard released](https://mithril.network/doc/dev-blog/2024/11/18/new-protocol-insights-dashboard)
- [Mithril aggregator Prometheus endpoint is available](https://mithril.network/doc/dev-blog/2024/11/07/mithril-aggregator-prometheus-endpoint).

### Protocol Insights Dashboard v2

We have created a new version of the Mithril Protocol Insights Dashboard, which is now available [here](https://lookerstudio.google.com/s/mbL23-8gibI). It provides a comprehensive view of the Mithril network and its performance metrics.

The Protocol Insights Dashboard is a valuable tool for monitoring the network and understanding its behavior:

- Participation metrics
- Usage metrics
- Health metrics
- Artifacts metrics
- Software metrics

### One line installer for Mithril binaries

In order to facilitate the installation and update of Mithril binaries, we have created a one line installer that downloads and installs the Mithril binaries for you. This installer is available for Linux and MacOS, and for the Mithril signer, Mithril aggregator, and Mithril CLI.

Here is an example command to download the **latest Mithril signer** binary in the current directory:

```shell
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://raw.githubusercontent.com/input-output-hk/mithril/refs/heads/main/mithril-install.sh | sh -s -- -c mithril-signer -d latest -p $(pwd)
```

Which will download the latest signer binary for the correct platform and architecture (if available) in the current directory:

```shell
Fetching release information from https://api.github.com/repos/input-output-hk/mithril/releases/latest...
Downloading mithril-signer to latest from https://github.com/input-output-hk/mithril/releases/download/2445.0/mithril-2445.0-linux-x64.tar.gz...
Congrats! mithril-signer has been upgraded to 0.2.209+67dc6e4 from distribution latest and installed at ./home/user!
```

### Client NPM package compatible with NodeJS

We have created a new version of the **npm package for the Mithril client WASM**, which is now compatible with NodeJS and bundler targets. This is feature that was requested by the community and which will be released in the next distribution `2550`.

### New Explorer Status

We have enhanced the Mithril Explorer with a new status section that provides some key metrics and insights about the Mithril network. This new section is currently available on testing networks and will be generally available with the release of the next distribution `2550`.
