### Roadmap

TODO: Update

Below are the latest updates on our roadmap:

- **Cardano database incremental snapshots MVP** [#2047](https://github.com/input-output-hk/mithril/issues/2047): we completed the implementation of the MVP for incremental snapshots of the Cardano database and plan to start releasing it on test networks next month.
- **Multiple aggregators on a Mithril Network PoC** [#2238](https://github.com/input-output-hk/mithril/issues/2238): we finalized the proof of concept (PoC) for multiple aggregators on a Mithril network. We are adapting the infrastructure to support this feature on selected test networks.

### Distributions

TODO: Update

We released Mithril distribution [`2513.0`](https://github.com/input-output-hk/mithril/releases/tag/2513.0), which includes:

- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Breaking** changes in Mithril nodes:
  - The **minimum required** `glibc` version for pre-built Linux binaries has been upgraded from `2.31` to `2.35`
  - Mithril signers running versions `<=0.2.200` **must be updated** due to the removal of Thales era legacy code
  - The `with_snapshot_uploader` function in the Mithril client library has been renamed to `with_file_uploader`
- Added support for Cardano node `10.2.1` in the signer and aggregator
- Ended support for **macOS x64 pre-built binaries** for the client CLI
- Bug fixes and performance improvements.

In April, the following events are planned:

- Release of a new distribution
- Activation of the incremental Cardano database certification (Cardano DB v2) on the `pre-release-preview` and `release-preprod` network.
