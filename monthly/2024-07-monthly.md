This is a monthly report on the progress of üê≤ Hydra and üõ° Mithril projects since June 2024. This document serves as a preparation for and a written summary of the monthly stakeholder review meeting, which is announced on our Discord channels and held on Google Meet. This month the meeting was held on 2024-07-22 using these [slides][slides] and [you can see the recording here][recording].

## Mithril

[Issues and pull requests closed in July](https://github.com/input-output-hk/mithril/issues?q=is%3Aclosed+sort%3Aupdated-desc+closed%3A2024-06-30..2024-07-31)

### Distributions

#### 2423.0

We have released the new Mithril distribution [`2428.0`](https://github.com/input-output-hk/mithril/releases/tag/2428.0). This distribution includes several critical updates and enhancements:
- Support for **Cardano node** `9.0.0`.
- Database cleanup and optimization once per epoch.
- Bug fixes and performance improvements.

#### Future distributions

We have planned to release two new distributions in August:
- `2430` (before the **Chang** hardfork):
  - Activation of the certification of **Cardano transactions** in the `release-preprod` network.
  - Support for **Cardano node** `9.1.0` on **all networks**.
- `2434` (after the **Chang** hardfork):
  - Activation of the certification of **Cardano transactions** in the `release-mainnet` network.

### Protocol status

Here is the status of the Mithril protocol on the Cardano `mainnet`:

### Transaction verification in Nami

TODO
- demo created by Blockfrost
- make status clear; i.e. this is/was only an experiment
- serving certificates through blockfrost?
- include video (hosted on youtube, loom, ipfs?)

### Transaction certification

We have kept working on the implementation of the Cardano transaction certification with Mithril and we are currently working on the rollout of the feature to production:

- We are finalizing the minimization of the signer footprint on the SPO infrastructure.
- We are preparing for activating the feature in the `release-preprod` network with the following release.
- We are preparing thorough documentation about the mechanism used to certify the transactions
- We have selected final parameters for signing the transactions:
  - `100` blocks from the tip of the chain (`~30 minutes`).
  - `30` blocks between snapshots certifying the transactions (`~10 minutes`).
  - With these parameters, we can consider the transactions final with very high probability.
  - These parameters are hot parameters that can be adjusted without requiring a new distribution

### Decentralized Message Queue CIP

We have kept working with the Cardano networking team to design a mechanism to implement a decentralized message queue which can be used in particular to decentralize the signature diffusion from Mithril signers to Mithril aggregators based on the Cardano network layer. The idea is to create a separate process for the decentralized message queue implementation:

- New dedicated process (aka "Mithril network node") which will be based on Ouroboros network stack.
- Bring a more efficient handling of resources consumptions (network and CPU) and avoid impact on the Cardano node performance of availability.
- Have a better security (as there will be no impact on the Cardano node).
- Both nodes will have a different release pace.
- Both nodes will be bundled in the Cardano node distribution release.
- A hard fork for SPO registration of the port of their Mithril network node is likely to be needed.

### Incremental decommits completed

TODO 
- include video https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1YespG5uangc9b9nKda9DZK6hZ0dni3SZ
- recap on cleanup / corner cases resolved this month 

### Repository moved

TODO
- https://github.com/input-output-hk/hydra -> https://github.com/cardano-scaling/hydra
- Most links redirected
- New docker images available under ghcr.io/cardano-scaling/hydra-node
- Roadmap project cannot be moved, copy of roadmap currently being filled üó∫ https://github.com/orgs/cardano-scaling/projects/7/views/1
- If you encounter broken links, just reach out on Discord or create an issue üôè https://github.com/cardano-scaling/hydra/issues/new/choose 

### Working group updates

TODO SN summarize findings of last two meetings on "What is Hydra Head V1"

- First work item of the working group https://github.com/cardano-scaling/wg-hydra
- Gathered valuable feedback from fellow layer 2 architects and Hydra users
- Goal: common understanding of what must be included in Hydra Head V1
- Next items:
  - When/how to audit Hydra Head V1?
  - CIP on standardizing interfaces to off-chain ledgers

## Conclusion
