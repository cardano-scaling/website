This is a monthly report on the progress of üê≤ Hydra and üõ° Mithril projects since April 2025. It serves as preparation for, and a written summary of, the monthly stakeholder review meeting. The meeting is announced on our Discord channels and held on Google Meet. This month, the meeting took place on May 28, 2025, using these [slides][slides], and you can see the [recording here][recording].

## Mithril

[Issues and pull requests closed in May](https://github.com/input-output-hk/mithril/issues?q=is%3Aclosed+sort%3Aupdated-desc+closed%3A2025-05-01..2025-05-30)

### Roadmap

Below are the latest updates on our roadmap:

- **DMQ signature diffusion prototype** [#2402](https://github.com/input-output-hk/mithril/issues/2402): we have started the second phase of the implementation of the DMQ signature diffusion prototype
- **Cardano database incremental snapshots MVP** [#2047](https://github.com/input-output-hk/mithril/issues/2047): we have activated the incremental snapshots on the `release-mainnet` network
- **Redesign the website and improve documentation** [#2051](https://github.com/input-output-hk/mithril/issues/2051): the home page redesign is in progress.

### Distributions

In May, we have completed the following events:

- Release of the new distribution [`2517`](https://github.com/input-output-hk/mithril/releases/tag/2517.1)
- Release of the security advisory [`GHSA-qv97-5qr8-2266`](https://github.com/input-output-hk/mithril/security/advisories/GHSA-qv97-5qr8-2266)
- Activation of the incremental Cardano database certification (Cardano DB v2) on the `release-mainnet` network.

In June, the following events are planned:

- Release of a new distribution (`2523`).

### Dev blog

We have published the following post:

- [Mithril Cardano database snapshots security advisory](https://mithril.network/doc/dev-blog/2025/05/07/client-security-advisory)
- [Breaking changes in client library and CLI](https://mithril.network/doc/dev-blog/2025/05/06/client-breaking-change)
- [Distribution `2517` is now available](https://mithril.network/doc/dev-blog/2025/05/05/distribution-2517)

### Signing ancillary files of the Cardano database

Here is a summary of the recent changes related to the signing of ancillary files in the Cardano database, and of the next steps for signing them with the Mithril protocol.:

#### Cardano Database Certification (v1 & v2)

- The Cardano database files, including ledger state snapshots and the last immutable file, differ across signers, which prevents Mithril from signing them.
- This inconsistency poses a risk, as it may be exploited in long-range attacks, especially when multiple aggregators are involved.
- A security alert has been published regarding this issue: GHSA-qv97-5qr8-2266.

#### Signing Ancillary Files with IOG Key

- The aggregator now signs ancillary files using GCP KMS and the IOG (Ancillary) key.
- The same `Ed25519` scheme as Genesis key signing is used for this process.
- This change introduces a breaking change in the latest Mithril client, affecting both the Library and CLI.
- Users now have the option to download immutable files either with or without ancillary files.

#### Signing Ledger State Snapshot with Mithril STM

- Signing the ledger state snapshot with Mithril STM requires synchronized snapshots across all Cardano nodes.
- If the process is deterministic, it becomes vulnerable to targeted attacks; therefore, a random delay per node should be used.
- The signing should occur only once per epoch, and a new data type for signing will be introduced.

#### All nodes must truncate the last immutable file at the same point at signing time

- The existing tools for this include the `db-truncater` CLI, which is complex and requires database duplication.
- Another available tool is Pallas `Hardano` from TxPipe, which can be used for chunk and index truncation.
- Alternatively, it is possible to avoid embedding the last immutable file altogether.

#### Implementation in a multi-node implementations ecosystem

- Implementing this in a multi-node ecosystem requires canonical formats for ledger state snapshots and immutable files.
- These canonical formats must be portable across all Cardano node implementations.
- A new CIP (Cardano Improvement Proposal) is currently being developed to standardize these formats.

### Protocol status

The protocol has operated smoothly on the `release-mainnet` network with the following metrics:
The protocol operated smoothly on the `release-mainnet` network with the following metrics:

- **Registered stake**: `4.6B‚Ç≥` (`21%` of the Cardano network)
- **Registered SPOs**: `240` (`9%` of the Cardano network)
- **Full Cardano database restorations**: `600` restorations
- **Signer software adoption**: `72.2%` of the SPOs are running a recent version (one of the last three releases).

## Hydra

[Issues and pull requests closed in May](https://github.com/cardano-scaling/hydra/issues?q=is%3Aclosed+sort%3Aupdated-desc+closed%3A2025-05-01..2025-05-30)

<small><center>Snapshot of the new [roadmap](https://github.com/orgs/cardano-scaling/projects/7/views/6) with features and ideas</center></small>

This month, notable [roadmap](https://github.com/orgs/cardano-scaling/projects/7/views/6) updates include:

### [0.21.0 Release](https://github.com/cardano-scaling/hydra/releases/tag/0.21.0)

We're very excited about this one as it is a huge release incorporating the
completely new networking layer via etcd. This means a few changes to the
command-line arguments (which you can read about in the [release
notes](https://github.com/cardano-scaling/hydra/releases/tag/0.21.0)).
Other important features are bounded memory usage, and some important bugfixes
around the observation of increments; but there is much more to read about in
the changelog! Go and grab the latest version now!

### Deposit fixes

### Blockfrost integration

### Roadmap update

We continue to focus on UX improvements and better logging/errors, while also
starting to tackle more of the user-reported bugs and feature requests.
