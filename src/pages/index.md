# Cardano Scaling

Collection of projects revolving around the common vision of increasing growth
and adoption of Cardano by solving scalability problems.

## Vision

We stand for growth and adoption of Cardano. To empower individuals, bank the
unbanked and be a viable decentralized alternative, scalability is not optional.
In fact, we believe there is only a decentralized future if it is scalable
enough.

## Mission

By making operation more flexible, faster, simpler, we remove entry barriers for
developers and end users, to ultimately become an enabling factor for new and
scalable applications on Cardano.

We build and maintain technological foundations (Mithril, Hydra, â€¦) to enable
custom solutions providing scalability and security. Besides creating open
platforms, we will engage in development of key products like payments, voting
and DeFI on Cardano.

         <a href="https://github.com/cardano-scaling/hydra">Hydra</a> is the
         layer-two scalability solution for Cardano, which aims to increase the speed
         of transactions (low latency, high throughput) and minimize transaction
         cost. The Hydra Head protocol allows applications to process transactions
         off-chain in a highly configurable ledger, but still using the same
         transaction format and tools as with Cardano.

         <a href="https://github.com/cardano-scaling/mithril">Mithril</a> is
         a cryptographic protocol and layer-two network in which stake pool
         operators attest to certain facts using their stake. Mithril signed
         snapshots of the Cardano blockchain enable fast-bootstrapping of nodes
         and applications running on Cardano in a trustless way.

         <a href="https://github.com/cardano-scaling/alba">ALBA</a> is
         a novel cryptographic type of <em>proof of knowledge</em> that allows a prover to convince a verifier
         they know a large set of elements verifying some predicate by providing a much smaller subset. It is
         useful to build <em>certificates</em> from large number of individual elements, like signatures or votes,
         assuming a significant majority of honest items.

         <a href="https://github.com/input-output-hk/peras-design">Peras</a> is an extension of Ouroboros Praos that addresses one of the known issues of blockchains based on Nakamoto-style consensus, namely settlement time. Peras achieves that goal while being self-healing, preserving the security of Praos, and being light on resources.

         an extension to Ouroboros Praos, the protocol powering Cardano, that dramatically increases the throughput of
         the network. It is currently in its <em>R&D</em> phase with the goal of producing a detailed specification for
         implementors.
