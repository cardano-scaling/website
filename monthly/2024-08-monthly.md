<small><center>Snapshot of the new [roadmap](https://github.com/orgs/cardano-scaling/projects/7/views/1) with features and ideas</center></small>

Notable updates on our [roadmap](https://github.com/orgs/cardano-scaling/projects/7/views/1) this month are:
- Point 1
- Point 2

<!--
- Completed incremental decommits, to be released separately as `0.18.0` after some remaining cleanup tasks and documentation updates
- Release `0.19.0` will be incremental decommits and, depending on the hard-fork date of Cardano mainnet, switching to Conway on the Hydra L2 ledger (see [March 2024](/monthly/2024-03#conway-support) for more details)
- Refined scope of "what is Hydra V1" through the Hydra working group
  - Added [SDK for wallet integration with Hydra #1509](https://github.com/cardano-scaling/hydra/issues/1509) to provide a better developer experience
  - Decided to implement [Directly open heads #1329](https://github.com/cardano-scaling/hydra/issues/1329) and [Partial fanout](https://github.com/cardano-scaling/hydra/issues/1468) to overcome our [known issue & limitations](https://hydra.family/head-protocol/docs/known-issues/) and supersede several other üí≠ ideas.
  - Prioritized [Optimistic head closure #198](https://github.com/cardano-scaling/hydra/issues/198) higher based on user feedback.
  - Declared [React to protocol parameter changes #195](https://github.com/cardano-scaling/hydra/issues/195) as not essential for a V1.
