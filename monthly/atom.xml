<i><sup>*</sup>: for testing purpose only</i>
<p>The network team has kept implementing the DMQ mini-protocols in the Haskell DMQ node. In the mean time, we have implemented a fake DMQ node which allowed us to test the Mithril nodes implementation of the DMQ protocol in an end to end test. This fake DMQ node is implemented in the Mithril relay which now exposes the server sides of the n2c submission and notification mini-protocols. Once the Haskell DMQ node is ready, we will replace the fake DMQ node with the real implementation.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="prototyping-snark-circuit-for-mithril-certificates">Prototyping SNARK circuit for Mithril certificates<a href="https://cardano-scaling.org/monthly/2025-08#prototyping-snark-circuit-for-mithril-certificates" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Prototyping SNARK circuit for Mithril certificates" title="Direct link to Prototyping SNARK circuit for Mithril certificates">‚Äã</a></h3>
<p>We worked on creating a Mithril certificate with a multi-signature that meets specific requirements for on-chain deployment. The current concatenation proof approach does not meet these constraints, as it exceeds 150 kB with a full stake distribution of approximately 2,000 individual signatures. This size is too large for on-chain storage (our target is &lt; 16 kB).</p>
<h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="requirements-and-solution">Requirements and solution<a href="https://cardano-scaling.org/monthly/2025-08#requirements-and-solution" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Requirements and solution" title="Direct link to Requirements and solution">‚Äã</a></h4>
<p>Our target requirements for the new approach are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Certificate storage on-chain with size under <strong>16 kB</strong></li>
<li>Fast verification performance (<strong>few milliseconds</strong>)</li>
<li>Relatively fast generation time (<strong>few minutes</strong>)</li>
<li>On-chain verification capability.</li>
</ul>
<p>We selected a SNARK generated with Halo2 as our solution, which provides:</p>
<ul>
<li>Expected multi-signature size of <strong>1-10 kB</strong></li>
<li>Expected verification time of <strong>1-10 ms</strong></li>
<li>Expected generation time of <strong>1-10 min</strong></li>
<li>Available primitives for smart contracts.</li>
</ul>
<h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="implementation-approaches">Implementation approaches<a href="https://cardano-scaling.org/monthly/2025-08#implementation-approaches" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Implementation approaches" title="Direct link to Implementation approaches">‚Äã</a></h4>
<p><strong>Faithful circuit transcription</strong>: Our initial approach attempted to create a circuit that faithfully replicates the actual concatenation proof, including BLS verification of aggregated signatures, Merkle proof inclusion in signer registration, and eligibility check with lottery. However, this proved unrealistic as just the BLS verification alone required approximately <strong>50 seconds</strong> with <strong>2^19 constraints</strong> on a <strong>48 CPU / 384 GB</strong> machine.</p>
<p><strong>Modified circuit transcription</strong>: We then developed a circuit that verifies all individual signatures one by one and makes sure that the lottery indices reach the quorum. We needed to modify the curve, individual signatures, hash function, and lottery function. This approach proved very efficient for approximately <strong>2,000</strong> signatures, achieving a certificate size of <strong>4 kB</strong>, verification time of <strong>7 ms</strong>, and generation time of <strong>6 minutes</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>ALBA proof circuit</strong>: We also tested an ALBA proof implementation and this approach proved even more efficient, maintaining the same <strong>4 kB</strong> certificate size and <strong>7 ms</strong> verification time while reducing generation time to just <strong>1.5 minutes</strong>.</p>
<p>Additionally, we also tested IVC (recursive SNARK) to limit the number of constraints, though this showed no substantial gain over the other approaches.</p>
<h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="roadmap-1">Roadmap<a href="https://cardano-scaling.org/monthly/2025-08#roadmap-1" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Roadmap" title="Direct link to Roadmap">‚Äã</a></h4>
<p><strong>Short term</strong>: Assess the minimal modifications needed for STM implementation, create a full report, adapt the STM library for SNARK compatibility (a breaking change that will require a Mithril era upgrade), and verify a Mithril certificate in a smart contract.</p>
<p><strong>Mid term</strong>: Deploy a SNARK for Mithril certificates on mainnet, audit both the STM and SNARK implementations, and implement ALBA, <em>Fait accompli</em>, and their corresponding SNARKs.</p>
<p><strong>Long term</strong>: Evaluate folding and recursive techniques for creating a SNARK of the entire certificate chain.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="protocol-status">Protocol status<a href="https://cardano-scaling.org/monthly/2025-08#protocol-status" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Protocol status" title="Direct link to Protocol status">‚Äã</a></h3>
<p>The protocol operated smoothly on the <code>release-mainnet</code> network with the following metrics:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Registered stake</strong>: <code>4.7B‚Ç≥</code> (<code>22%</code> of the Cardano network)</li>
<li><strong>Registered SPOs</strong>: <code>249</code> (<code>9%</code> of the Cardano network)</li>
<li><strong>Full Cardano database restorations</strong>: <code>710</code> restorations</li>
<li><strong>Signer software adoption</strong>: <code>82.9%</code> of the SPOs are running a recent version (one of the last three releases).</li>

<p>We delivered a minimal monitoring setup using Prometheus and Grafana to provide insight into Hydra node activity, including snapshot processing and peer connectivity.</p>
<p>This was added as part of the <em>Getting Started</em> tutorial, making it easier for users to quickly visualize the exposed node metrics.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The setup focused exclusively on metrics exposed by Hydra nodes and did not include system-level metrics such as CPU, memory, disk, or network usage.</p>

<p>The Cardano node database v2 certification offers incremental verification and greater efficiency compared to the original method. It will progressively replace the current certification process for the Cardano node internal database.</p>
<p>In particular, the <code>cardano-db</code> command in the Mithril client CLI has been updated to support the new incremental certification process and eventually a seamless switch to the new backend. A new <code>--backend</code> option has been added to the command, allowing users to specify the certification version:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>--backend v1</code> uses the original Cardano node database certification (this remains the default)</li>

<p>With the release of the new 2524 distribution, the <code>tools</code> command has been added to the Mithril client CLI. The new <code>tools utxo-hd snapshot-converter</code> subcommand simplifies node bootstrapping by converting the restored ledger state snapshot into the required UTxO-HD flavor (<code>LMDB</code> or <code>Legacy</code>).</p>
<p>The following command can be used to convert a restored ledger state snapshot into the UTXO-HD flavor:</p>

<p>Here is a summary of the recent changes related to the signing of ancillary files in the Cardano database, and of the next steps for signing them with the Mithril protocol:</p>
<h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="cardano-database-certification-v1-and-v2">Cardano database certification (v1 and v2)<a href="https://cardano-scaling.org/monthly/2025-05#cardano-database-certification-v1-and-v2" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Cardano database certification (v1 and v2)" title="Direct link to Cardano database certification (v1 and v2)">‚Äã</a></h4>
<ul>
<li>The Cardano database files, including ledger state snapshots and the last immutable file, differ across signers, which prevents Mithril from signing them.</li>
<li>This inconsistency poses a risk, as it may be exploited in long-range attacks, especially when multiple aggregators are involved.</li>
<li>A security alert has been published regarding this issue: GHSA-qv97-5qr8-2266.</li>
</ul>
<h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="signing-ancillary-files-with-iog-key">Signing ancillary files with IOG key<a href="https://cardano-scaling.org/monthly/2025-05#signing-ancillary-files-with-iog-key" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Signing ancillary files with IOG key" title="Direct link to Signing ancillary files with IOG key">‚Äã</a></h4>
<ul>
<li>The aggregator now signs ancillary files using GCP KMS and the IOG (Ancillary) key.</li>
<li>The same <code>Ed25519</code> scheme as Genesis key signing is used for this process.</li>
<li>This change introduces a breaking change in the latest Mithril client, affecting both the Library and CLI.</li>
<li>Users now have the option to download immutable files either with or without ancillary files.</li>
</ul>
<h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="signing-ledger-state-snapshot-with-mithril-stm">Signing ledger state snapshot with Mithril STM<a href="https://cardano-scaling.org/monthly/2025-05#signing-ledger-state-snapshot-with-mithril-stm" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Signing ledger state snapshot with Mithril STM" title="Direct link to Signing ledger state snapshot with Mithril STM">‚Äã</a></h4>
<ul>
<li>Signing the ledger state snapshot with Mithril STM requires synchronized snapshots across all Cardano nodes.</li>
<li>If the process is deterministic, it becomes vulnerable to targeted attacks; therefore, a random delay per node should be used.</li>
<li>The signing should occur only once per epoch, and a new data type for signing will be introduced.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>The existing tools for this include the <code>db-truncater</code> CLI, which is complex and requires database duplication.</li>
<li>Another available tool is Pallas <code>Hardano</code> from TxPipe, which can be used for chunk and index truncation.</li>
<li>Alternatively, it is possible to avoid embedding the last immutable file altogether.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>Implementing this in a multi-node ecosystem requires canonical formats for ledger state snapshots and immutable files.</li>
<li>These canonical formats must be portable across all Cardano node implementations.</li>
<li>A new CIP (Cardano Improvement Proposal) is currently being developed to standardize these formats.</li>

<p>We're very excited about this one as it is a huge release incorporating the
completely new networking layer via etcd. This means a few changes to the
command-line arguments (which you can read about in the <a href="https://github.com/cardano-scaling/hydra/releases/tag/0.21.0" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">release
notes</a>).
Other important features are bounded memory usage, and some important bugfixes
around the observation of increments; but there is much more to read about in
the changelog! Go and grab the latest version now!</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="deposit-fixes">Deposit fixes<a href="https://cardano-scaling.org/monthly/2025-05#deposit-fixes" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Deposit fixes" title="Direct link to Deposit fixes">‚Äã</a></h3>
<p>Over the last two months, we have been fixing the incremental commit workflow and making it more robust against various edge cases related to rollbacks. Before, the <code>hydra-node</code> was very optimistic when observing a deposit posted to the chain, while possibility of double spends of the deposited funds must be prevented in presence of rollbacks.</p>
<p>This is now done by introducing a deposit period, which limits the minimum and maximum age of a deposit to be considered. The <code>--deposit-period</code> command line option supersedes <code>--deposit-deadline</code> which was only setting the time before a deposit may be picked up. The picture below shows the life cycle of a deposit which is only considered <strong>active</strong> after one deposit period has passed, and it is considered <strong>expired</strong> if less then a deposit period is left before the deadline; from where onwards a user may recover the funds. The upper validity bound of the deposit transaction is used as a starting point and we also added server outputs to signal activation and expiry of deposits. A query endpoint to list all known deposits is not avaiable right now, but likely introduced in course of doing <a href="https://github.com/cardano-scaling/hydra/issues/1812" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">hydra#1812</a>.</p>

<p>After making posible to publish hydra scripts using Blockfrost we continued
with the integration so now <code>hydra-node</code> can run using a Blockfrost backend.
This option makes running the <code>hydra-node</code> a bit easier since one does not need
to run local <code>cardano-node</code> to connect to which greatly simplifies the setup.</p>
<p>Blockfrost is videly used so making this integration possible in <code>hydra-node</code>
should make experimenting and prototyping with Hydra more approachable.</p>

<p>Event log rotation was introduced to improve recovery times by reducing the number of events that need to be replayed on startup. This is achieved by periodically replacing the current event log with a new one that starts from a checkpoint event, which captures the latest aggregated head state.</p>
<p>Only the rotated logs are saved with an incrementing logId, while the main state file name remains unchanged to preserve backward compatibility. Rotation can be enabled via the new optional --persistence-rotate-after command line option, which specifies the number of events after which rotation should occur.</p>
<p>Additionally, a server output was added to notify external agents when a checkpoint occurs, enabling them to perform archival or cleanup actions without interrupting the Hydra head.</p>

<p>In order to better standardise code quality across multiple repositories, we have extracted
all of our quality control tooling to a flake-parts module called <a href="https://github.com/cardano-scaling/hydra-coding-standards" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">hydra-coding-standards</a>.
This contains all kinds of formatting checks, dead code elimination, and static analysis checks
for haskell and nix, as well as typo checking. We are rolling these standardisation checks to more
cardano-scaling repositories, which will enable a more uniform experience for active and external contributors.</p>

<p>The current proof system used for Mithril aggregation is the Concatenation proof system, which has the following properties:</p>
<ul>
<li>The size of the multi-signature increases quasi-linearly with the number of signers</li>
<li>Verification is efficient, requiring only a single pairing operation, regardless of how many signers are involved</li>
<li>It is not SNARK-friendly.</li>
</ul>

<small></small></p><center><small>The Concatenation aggregation proof system</small></center><p></p>
<p>During the development of this proof of concept, we explored the following questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Is it possible to utilize the ALBA proof system to reduce the size of the multi-signature while maintaining fast verification?</li>
<li>Can different proof systems, such as Concatenation and Centralized ALBA, be combined within an aggregator's certificate chain?</li>
<li>What are the implications of introducing a new aggregation proof system on the overall Mithril network?</li>
</ul>
<p>Using the <strong>Centralized ALBA proof system</strong>, we've been able to draw the following conclusions::</p>
<ul>
<li>Mithril multi-signatures can be compressed to reduce their size while still enabling fast verification</li>
<li>No changes are needed on the Mithril signer side, simplifying deployment</li>
<li>It is possible to combine different types of proofs within a single certificate chain</li>
<li>Different aggregators within the same Mithril network can operate using distinct proof systems‚Äîfor instance, a leader using the Concatenation proof system while a follower uses the Centralized ALBA proof system.</li>
</ul>
<p>This proof of concept has surfaced several important questions and challenges:</p>
<ul>
<li>Further research is needed to align Mithril and ALBA protocol parameters, ensuring equivalent levels of security and reliability</li>
<li>Additional investigation is required to assess the achievable compression ratio of the Centralized ALBA proof system given the stake distribution on the Cardano mainnet</li>
<li>We aim to explore the Decentralized ALBA proof system to determine whether it can offer improved compression while maintaining the same security and reliability ‚Äì though this would involve significant changes to both the Mithril signer and aggregator due to a different lottery mechanism</li>
</ul>

<p>We explored solutions for running multiple aggregators on the same Mithril network. This is a complex problem that requires consensus on signer registration among enough signers and aggregators so that at least the required quorum can be achieved. Currently, the aggregator stores signer registration payloads and distributes them back to signers a couple of epochs later. This is a centralized approach (a single point of failure) that may be subject to censorship, but there is no trust assumption on the aggregator because every party in the protocol independently verifies the cryptographic proofs included in the payloads.</p>
<p>We identified three possible solutions:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Extend the centralized approach to multiple aggregators</strong>: slave aggregators pull signer registration payloads from the master aggregator at every epoch change, rejecting any registrations sent directly to their API. We prototyped this solution, which unlocks decentralized signature diffusion while maintaining a central authority for registration. 2.<strong>Use the Cardano chain</strong>: aggregators create a transaction to store their Mithril keys on chain at the start of each epoch. This approach is fully decentralized but more complex operationally. It requires SPOs to maintain a hot wallet for transaction creation, adding cost and maintenance. This is likely the more natural long-term solution.</li>
<li><strong>Use the DMQ</strong>: the DMQ (Decentralized Message Queue as described in the <a href="https://github.com/cardano-scaling/CIPs/tree/master/CIP-0137" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">CIP-0137</a>) is authenticated which means that we can detect adversary signers which would equivocate their signer registration (i.e. send different payloads to different peers on the network to create a split of the network and thus prevent reaching the quorum needed to create a Mithril multi-signature). Any peer on the network that would receive two different payloads from the same signer would create a proof of equivocation and broadcast it on the network. Upon reception of a valid equivocation proof, the other peers of the network would discard the registration from the adversary and reach an agreement on the signer registration. This solution would be fully decentralized and would not incur any cost for the SPOs. It is at a very early stage of exploration and we will keep working on it.</li>

If a signer attempts to submit conflicting payloads, other peers can broadcast a proof of equivocation, causing the network to discard the adversary‚Äôs registration. This approach is fully decentralized and does not impose additional costs on SPOs. Exploration is in progress.

<p>Feature: <a href="https://github.com/cardano-scaling/hydra/issues/1720" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">#1720</a></p>
<p>The <code>etcd</code>-based networking feature is now fully merged and has undergone several improvements. Highlights include bug fixes, <a href="https://github.com/cardano-scaling/hydra/pull/1884" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">improved observability</a>, <a href="https://github.com/cardano-scaling/hydra/pull/1914" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">protocol version checking</a>, and a breaking <a href="https://github.com/cardano-scaling/hydra/pull/1891" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">change in command line options</a> (<code>--listen</code> and <code>--advertise</code>) see release notes for more details.</p>
<p>Extensive testing through our friends working on the Midnight glacier drop makes us confident to release this soon as a cornerstone of the <a href="https://github.com/cardano-scaling/hydra/milestone/22?closed=1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><code>0.21.0</code> release</a>.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="bounded-memory">Bounded memory<a href="https://cardano-scaling.org/monthly/2025-03#bounded-memory" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Bounded memory" title="Direct link to Bounded memory">‚Äã</a></h3>
<p>After preliminary work on bounding memory by <a href="https://github.com/cardano-scaling/hydra/pull/1808" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">streaming events</a> and implementing the <a href="https://github.com/cardano-scaling/hydra/pull/1860" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">API server as an event sink</a> last month, we achieved fully bounded memory usage of <code>hydra-node</code> when processing millions of transactions and loading from disk (<a href="https://github.com/cardano-scaling/hydra/pull/1920" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">#1920</a>).</p>
<p>A typical memory profile of a <code>hydra-node</code> using <strong>~1GB</strong> of memory when loading millions of transactions from the <code>state</code> file before this work:</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://cardano-scaling.org/assets/images/2025-03-profile-before-2408d36ab2436336d1ff549395ebd9bf.svg" width="1280" height="720" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<p>Which indicates a Haskell-classic space leak because of thunk build-up. Indeed we spotted that <code>allTxs</code> in the <code>HeadState</code> was not fully forced when loading events from disk and with an additional strictness annotation, loading the same <code>state</code> file now while only using <strong>12MB</strong> of memory:</p>

<p>We explored mirror nodes to improve fault tolerance for Hydra heads. A participant can run multiple instances of <code>hydra-node</code> using the same <code>--hydra-signing-key</code> and <code>--cardano-signing-key</code>, allowing snapshot signing to continue even if one node goes down.</p>
<p>Preliminary experiments showed this approach works without modifications to <code>hydra-node</code>, but:</p>
<ul>
<li>Each additional node increases the number of messages submitted through the Hydra network</li>
<li>Too many mirrors of one party could imbalance the etcd quorum and make the network unavailable overall although there would be enough signers for the Hydra consensus.</li>
</ul>

<p>Feature: <a href="https://github.com/cardano-scaling/hydra/issues/1858" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">#1858</a></p>
<p>Originally, we wanted to address so-called 'stuck' heads to address ledger state divergence among Hydra nodes, we introduced <a href="https://github.com/cardano-scaling/hydra/pull/1864" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">snapshot sideloading</a>. This mechanism allows nodes to adopt a confirmed snapshot to regain consensus when misalignment occurs, preventing the Hydra head from getting stuck and ensuring a consistent state across all nodes.</p>

<p>Feature: <a href="https://github.com/cardano-scaling/hydra/issues/1795" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">#1795</a></p>
<p>This feature was requested by multiple users in <a href="https://github.com/cardano-scaling/hydra/issues/1795" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GitHub</a> and on our Discord channel, and it was identified as beneficial for the Midnight glacier drop.</p>
<p>The so-called 'withdraw zero trick' is a common technique to achieve verification on a transaction level (once per tx). In fact, it's the only way to do this until <a href="https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/blob/master/CIP-0112/README.md" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">CIP-112</a> gets implemented by the <code>cardano-ledger</code> (and <code>plutus</code>).</p>
<p>While the layer 2 ledger in Hydra is isomorphic to Cardano with respect to the EUTXO ledger model, this excludes Cardano's proof-of-stake features. Consequently, one could not register scripts as reward accounts and use withdrawing <code>0 lovelace</code> as a trick to have those scripts validate transactions.</p>
<p>To implement this feature, @coll78 and @ch1bo found that the <code>hydra-node</code> can mock <code>RewardAccount</code>s for each <code>0 lovelace</code> withdrawal observed in a transaction on-the-fly. This results in the script being evaluated, and even does not require the script to be registered via a stake delegation certificate beforehand.</p>

<p>In combination with the etcd-based networking, we have been <a href="https://github.com/cardano-scaling/hydra/pull/1860" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">working on bounding
the memory</a> of the
hydra-node by switching to an event-streaming model, instead of loading and
keeping all events in memory. This should allow for the long-term running of
hydra nodes. This work remains in progress.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Cardano stake distribution certification</strong> <a href="https://github.com/input-output-hk/mithril/issues/955" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">#955</a>: the feature has been activated on <code>mainnet</code></li>
<li><strong>Cardano database incremental snapshots MVP</strong> <a href="https://github.com/input-output-hk/mithril/issues/2047" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">#2047</a>: we have kept working on the MVP for incremental snapshots of the Cardano database</li>

<p>We released Mithril distribution <a href="https://github.com/input-output-hk/mithril/releases/tag/2450.0" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><code>2450.0</code></a>, which includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>üî• <strong>Breaking changes in the Mithril client library, CLI, and WASM</strong> with the removal of the deprecated <code>network</code> field from the internal <code>CardanoDbBeacon</code> in Mithril certificates</li>
<li>Stable support for <strong>Cardano node</strong> <code>10.1.3</code> in the signer and the aggregator</li>
<li>Stable support for one line shell installation script of the Mithril nodes' pre-built binaries</li>
<li>Bug fixes and performance improvements.</li>
</ul>
<p>In February, the following events are planned:</p>
<ul>
<li>Switch to the <strong>Pythagoras</strong> era on the <code>release-mainnet</code> network (at the transition to epoch <code>539</code>)</li>
<li>Re-genesis of the certificate chain of the <code>release-mainnet</code> network (at the end of epoch <code>539</code>)</li>
<li>Release of a new distribution at epoch <code>540</code>.</li>

<p>We have worked on the signature and artifact production processes of the incremental Cardano DB certification. The features are now deployed on the developer networks and are being tested.</p>
<p>The incremental certification will provide the following benefits:</p>
<ul>
<li>Faster certification of the Cardano DB on the aggregator</li>
<li>Capability to restore a partial Cardano database instead of the full one (by providing a range of missing immutable files)</li>
<li>Capability to support an evolutive range of artifact storages, particularly decentralized storages (eg, IPFS or BitTorrent).</li>

</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Phase 1: node integration</strong>
<ul>
<li>Bundle Mithril with the Cardano node</li>
<li>Seamless integration</li>
<li>Opt-out option</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Phase 2: centralized incentive mechanism</strong>
<ul>
<li>Centralized reward distribution</li>
<li>Treasury funded via external funds</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Phase 3: on-chain incentive mechanism</strong>
<ul>
<li>On-chain reward distribution mechanism</li>
<li>Treasury funded through revenues.</li>

<p>The protocol has operated smoothly on the <code>release-mainnet</code> network with the following metrics:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Registered stake</strong>: <code>4.9B‚Ç≥</code> (<code>25%</code> of the Cardano network)</li>
<li><strong>Registered SPOs</strong>: <code>250</code> (<code>9%</code> of the Cardano network)</li>
<li><strong>Full Cardano database restorations</strong>: <code>600</code> restorations</li>
<li><strong>Signer software adoption</strong>: <code>94%</code> of the SPOs are running a recent version (one of the last three releases).</li>

<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="hydra-doom-finale">Hydra Doom finale<a href="https://cardano-scaling.org/monthly/2025-01#hydra-doom-finale" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Hydra Doom finale" title="Direct link to Hydra Doom finale">‚Äã</a></h3>
<p>On January 24, 2025, the Hydra Doom tournament concluded with its finale at the <a href="https://lu.ma/cplay?tk=RqNYcG" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">C-Play Summit event</a> at the HyperX Arena in Las Vegas. This live e-sports event featured finalists from previous hydra-doom stages battling in a multiplayer deathmatch on stage, using our reimagining of the 1993 first-person shooter <em>Doom</em>. For a high-level summary, see this <a href="https://hackernoon.com/hydra-achieves-1-million-tps-validating-cardano-as-the-fastest-blockchain" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Hackernoon article</a>.</p>
<p>Let‚Äôs look a bit under the hood at what was deployed for this finale. Previous installments of the <code>hydra-doom</code> application processed player inputs and game state updates as Cardano transactions on a fleet of remotely hosted <code>hydra-node</code> processes and Hydra heads. This time, our fork of the <em>Doom</em> <a href="https://github.com/cardano-scaling/doom-wasm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">doom-wasm</a> port used Hydra to create a <a href="https://github.com/cardano-scaling/doom-wasm/blob/9375223120772539e21165907cff8a1a9cf19bc3/src/net_hydra.c#L193-L196" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">net_module_t</a> that converts <em>Doom</em> multiplayer network packets to Cardano transactions and uses the Cardano ledger in a Hydra head to exchange them between multiple players. On top of this, each player‚Äôs kills were also recorded 'on-chain' from similar transactions as used in the past. This allowed a referee Hydra participant to use the datum on-chain to update a 'Series' smart contract and gather kill totals as a datum in a Cardano UTXO (on layer 2).</p>
<p>Given the results of three deathmatch rounds, a winner was determined, and all finalists received prize tokens for 1st to 4th place. These tokens were minted before the finale on layer 1, committed into the head, and distributed to known finalist addresses <em>in the head</em>. Closing and finalizing this head onto mainnet distributed the prize NFTs.</p>
<p>The tournament‚Äôs head ID was <code>d3ad8ab3bbaf06ccadd7076ff3a84eaca0771bb9dcea8bcce239eca9</code>, and you can view the <a href="https://cexplorer.io/policy/d3ad8ab3bbaf06ccadd7076ff3a84eaca0771bb9dcea8bcce239eca9/tx#data" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">associated transactions here</a>. <a href="https://cexplorer.io/tx/09010ab28996c6e75fb3fcda998f7190d71357eec31a110906bfdb6127a23392" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">This is the fanout transaction</a> that distributed the prize tokens.</p>
<p>Using these tokens, the winners could redeem their prize money from smart contracts where the USDM prize money for the finale was locked, as seen <a href="https://cexplorer.io/tx/99864dd973d1fe45e69e8b94dbbca4a4533b60dbe34517d1c8d8928fbabd945b" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here for the 1st place trophy</a>.</p>

<p>We have implemented nightly and backward compatibility workflows to ensure more reliable and consistent releases. The nightly workflow builds Mithril Docker images every night and runs the backward compatibility workflow, which checks the compatibility of the upcoming Mithril distribution with previous versions, summarizing the changes.</p>

<p>Notable updates on our <a href="https://github.com/orgs/cardano-scaling/projects/7/views/1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">roadmap</a> this month include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Progress on incremental commits <a href="https://github.com/cardano-scaling/hydra/issues/199" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">#199</a></li>
<li>Hydra + Midnight support <a href="https://github.com/cardano-scaling/hydra/issues/1727" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">#1727</a></li>
<li>Continued support of Hydra Doom, especially around the tournament!</li>

<p>The hydra-explorer has been <a href="https://github.com/cardano-scaling/hydra-explorer/pull/5" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">moved to its own repository</a> with independent deployment. As a result, supporting multiple versions of the <code>hydra-node</code> in the explorer is now necessary, and we are <a href="https://github.com/cardano-scaling/hydra/issues/1282" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">currently working on it</a>.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="hydra-doom">Hydra Doom<a href="https://cardano-scaling.org/monthly/2024-11#hydra-doom" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Hydra Doom" title="Direct link to Hydra Doom">‚Äã</a></h3>
<p>Following the success of Hydra Doom at Rare Evo and as an activation at various events organized by Input | Output (IO) <strong>and others(!)</strong>, the Hydra Doom project has taken a significant step forward with the launch of a tournament offering 100,000 USDM. The prize is intended to be distributed automatically to the winners based on the outcome of the game as measured in the Hydra heads used for the finale.</p>
<p>In launching the tournament, we reached several milestones and pushed Hydra to its very limits in many ways. This included testing the performance of individual Hydra heads, which supported a multi-player game where every frame of each participant‚Äôs game session submitted smart contract transactions. At its peak (on December 3), the system processed 1.04 million transactions per second. Over a 24-hour period, it handled more than 15.5 billion transactions in total. This was achieved with a mix of real player traffic from around the world and artificial load generated by bots running the game, contributing transactions to more than 14,000 Hydra Heads.</p>
<p>While more work remains, this marks an impressive milestone, and the overall reception has been positive.</p>

<p>The incremental commits feature is nearly ready for release. As a final step, we invite community members to test-drive this feature. The goal is to ensure the best user experience and identify potential bugs. The remaining tasks include improving documentation and testing and updating the protocol specification to reflect these changes.</p>

<p>We‚Äôve been collaborating with the Midnight team to explore how Hydra can align with their goals. As part of this effort, we‚Äôre developing a version of Hydra with a custom ledger to support arbitrary built-in operations that validators may need. <a href="https://github.com/cardano-scaling/hydra/issues/1727" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">This work is ongoing.</a></p>

<p>To enable multiple aggregators on the same Mithril network, the <strong>signature orchestration</strong> must be decentralized to run independently across all signers and aggregators.</p>
<p>We have implemented and deployed this feature on<code>mainnet</code> with the signer released in <a href="https://github.com/input-output-hk/mithril/releases/tag/2442.0" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><code>2442.0</code></a> distribution:</p>
<ul>
<li>The signer and aggregator nodes can independently compute the beacon, which determines the messages to sign and certify</li>
<li>The aggregator no longer advertises the pending certificates; the pending certificate is deprecated and temporarily kept alive for legacy signer nodes until sufficient adoption of the new version is reached</li>
<li>The aggregator buffers the individual signatures received from signers until it has computed the associated beacon and will try to aggregate them thereafter.</li>
</ul>

<p>We have been working on a new Prometheus endpoint for the aggregator, which provides detailed insights about the production of artifacts and certificates, the events received from the signers, and the artifacts and proofs served to the clients. The feature can be easily activated with some configuration parameters.</p>
<p>Additionally, we created a Grafana template to easily set up a dashboard for this Prometheus endpoint.</p>

<p>IOG attended a local satellite Cardano Summit event, as well as Tech Expo ‚Äì a multichain Web3-focused event ‚Äì in Argentina on October 18 and 19. During both events, the Hydra Doom demo was showcased on-site, using locally built cabinets and a new setup with a computer as an on-site server, connecting laptops to aggregate stats from multiple sessions. Many attendees had the chance to play and enjoy the demo, with our very own Tamara Haasen displaying true grit and remarkable skill! Notable attendees included ICP, Polkadot, OKX, ByBit, and the founder of Render Network. Overall, it was a fantastic event and a great opportunity to connect with Argentinian builders. Now it‚Äôs time to prepare for the next leg of the Hydra Doom adventure and gear up for a return visit soon!</p>

<p>We began porting our validators to Aiken, starting with the <code>Commit</code> validator. This resulted in a saving of over 1Kb to the validator script and increased the maximum number of head participants from 6 to 9.</p>

<p>We continued working on the <strong>decentralized message queue</strong> (DMQ) for Cardano, as proposed in this <a href="https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/pull/876" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">CIP draft</a>.</p>
<p>The DMQ is designed to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Leverage the Cardano network layer</li>
<li>Initially be used by Mithril for the diffusion of signatures from signers to aggregators</li>
<li>Be adaptable for future Cardano protocols, each operating on a different DMQ topic.</li>
</ul>
<p>The DMQ will be operated by a 'side' node, known as the DMQ node, which will run a separate peer-to-peer network powered by the Ouroboros network stack. Here are some key technical details:</p>
<ul>
<li>It will run as an external process that exposes a Unix socket to support node-to-client mini-protocols</li>
<li>It will implement node-to-client and node-to-node mini-protocols to allow for message local submission, local notification, and peer-to-peer submission</li>
<li>It will retrieve the Cardano stake distribution from its local Cardano node to authenticate incoming messages</li>
<li>It will retrieve other peers' information about the peer-to-peer network from its local Cardano node (this topic is being investigated: either with a ledger hard fork, redirecting connections to the DMQ node, or leveraging the SRV record in the SPOs' DNS)</li>
<li>Each topic of the message queue will run a different DMQ node instantiated with a specific configuration.</li>
</ul>
<p>Producers and consumers exist for the DMQ topic running on some DMQ nodes. In the case of Mithril:</p>
<ul>
<li>The Mithril signers will be the producers of the message (Mithril individual signatures)</li>
<li>The Mithril aggregators will be the consumers of the message (Mithril individual signatures).</li>
</ul>
<p>DMQ producers and consumers run on various DMQ nodes:</p>

<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="spike-head-in-head">Spike: head-in-head<a href="https://cardano-scaling.org/monthly/2024-09#spike-head-in-head" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Spike: head-in-head" title="Direct link to Spike: head-in-head">‚Äã</a></h3>
<p>When a Hydra head is opened, part of the underlying ledger state gets locked and made available off-chain to a small group of participants. While this already creates a 'small world' to process transactions (which makes it fast and cheap), we encountered use cases where it would make sense to open additional heads with different or even smaller groups of participants on parts of the layer 2 state, forming layer 3 heads.</p>
<p>One example of this use case is the Hydra Doom demonstration we <a href="https://cardano-scaling.org/monthly/2024-08#hydra-doom">presented at Rare Evo last month</a>. For example, individual multiplayer game sessions require low network latency from regionally close machines. If those machines run a game session head that, in turn, locks funds and game state from a slower global tournament head instance, we are discussing Hydra heads in heads.</p>
<p>This construction raises <strong>many open questions about liveness</strong>: what happens to the layer 3 head if the layer 2 head stops processing transactions? Such pessimistic scenarios can occur in any optimistic protocol and must be addressed, though not necessarily optimized for. Despite these and other uncertainties, we spent time this month exploring whether it‚Äôs even possible as part of the spike issue <a href="https://github.com/cardano-scaling/hydra/issues/1590" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">#1590</a>.</p>
<p>Technically, this means that a <code>hydra-node</code> communicates with another <code>hydra-node</code> as its 'chain backend', interpreting snapshots of the layer 2 head as blocks, observing transactions that open or close the head, and submitting its state transition transactions to the underlying layer 2 ledger. The spike issue provides more details and instructions on reproducing these findings. The following issues demonstrate this prototype <code>--inception</code> mode:</p>

<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="hydra--blockfrost-chain-backend-concept">Hydra ü§ù Blockfrost: chain backend concept<a href="https://cardano-scaling.org/monthly/2024-09#hydra--blockfrost-chain-backend-concept" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Hydra ü§ù Blockfrost: chain backend concept" title="Direct link to Hydra ü§ù Blockfrost: chain backend concept">‚Äã</a></h3>
<p>As outlined in <a href="https://github.com/cardano-scaling/hydra/issues/1305" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">#1305</a>, we are considering an option to run the <code>hydra-node</code> in a more lightweight mode, without requiring the full <code>cardano-node</code>. This feature is particularly relevant when considering the use of Hydra with the pay-per-use Blockfrost API.</p>
<p>To complete this component, the Blockfrost chain layer must be capable of:</p>
<ul>
<li>Following the chain</li>
<li>Submitting Hydra transactions</li>
<li>Handling relevant internal wallet queries for the <code>hydra-node</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p>As an initial step, we have developed:</p>
<ul>
<li>A Hydra chain observer that operates in Blockfrost mode (although it has not yet been integrated into the <code>hydra-node</code>)</li>
<li>A variant of the <code>hydra-explorer</code> tailored to the Blockfrost-enabled Hydra chain observer.</li>
</ul>
<p>To achieve this, we have used a straightforward roll-forward approach via the Blockfrost <a href="https://docs.blockfrost.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">HTTP API</a>, relying on the following key API calls:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>GET /blocks/{hash}</code>
<ul>
<li><em>confirmations</em>: number of block confirmations</li>
<li><em>next_block_hash</em>: (nullable) hash of the next block</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><code>GET /blocks/{hash}/txs</code></li>
<li><code>GET /txs/{hash}/cbor</code></li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>Basically, we continuously fetch specific blocks by their hash, using the number of confirmations to indicate the block's safety (minimizing the likelihood of a rollback). From there, we roll forward using the reference to the next block hash.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>While this mechanism might appear simplistic, it is highly effective for most use cases except scenarios involving exchanges.</p>
<p>To further optimize the performance of this new chain component, we‚Äôve raised two new issues on the Blockfrost side to support our work:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/blockfrost/blockfrost-backend-ryo/issues/209" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">#209</a>: add an endpoint to fetch all transaction CBORs in a block, reducing the number of API calls needed to retrieve Hydra head observations from block transactions</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/blockfrost/blockfrost-haskell/issues/67" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">#67</a>: implement concurrent fetching to fully leverage parallel requests and enhance performance.</li>
</ul>
<p>Moving forward, our next objective is to enable the <code>hydra-node</code> to publish Hydra scripts via Blockfrost, as outlined in <a href="https://github.com/cardano-scaling/hydra/issues/1668" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">#1668</a>.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="spike-raft-based-networking">Spike: Raft-based networking<a href="https://cardano-scaling.org/monthly/2024-09#spike-raft-based-networking" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Spike: Raft-based networking" title="Direct link to Spike: Raft-based networking">‚Äã</a></h3>
<p>Last month, we developed a new test suite <a href="https://github.com/cardano-scaling/hydra/issues/1532" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">#1532</a> to assess the resilience of our network stack. Now that this is in place, we can start exploring different approaches to achieve our goal of a crash-tolerant network layer.</p>
<p>Recently, we stumbled upon this <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1707.01873" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">fairly old research paper</a> that explored various consensus protocols used in blockchain space. It reminded us of the correspondence between consensus and broadcasts:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The form of consensus relevant to blockchain is technically known as atomic broadcast</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Additionally, it mentioned at least one early permissioned blockchain that achieved crash tolerance of <code>t &lt; n/2</code> by using <a href="https://etcd.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">etcd</a> with its off-the-shelf <a href="https://raft.github.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Raft</a> consensus algorithm. This prompted us to explore the possibility of replacing our custom network stack with this (arguably overkill) alternative in an experiment <a href="https://github.com/cardano-scaling/hydra/issues/1591" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">#1591</a> to evaluate its performance.</p>
<p>The GitHub issue contains all the details, but it turns out that this idea might not be as exotic as we initially thought! Implementing <code>broadcast</code> functionality as <code>put</code> requests to the <code>etcd</code> cluster works well when combined with an outbound, persisted buffer that handles failed writes while disconnected (or only connected to a minority). Additionally, the <code>revision</code> mechanism of <code>etcd</code> and storing the last known revision on disk allow us to create a <code>hydra-node</code> that is fully resilient to crashes and network failures, as demonstrated in these <a href="https://github.com/cardano-scaling/hydra/actions/runs/11067586032" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">fault injection test runs</a>.</p>
<p>Even the performance of this early prototype matches or exceeds our current implementation, especially when multi-threading performance is available. For example, using a low-powered container hosted on GitHub, we observed average confirmation times on the three-node benchmark decrease from <code>20ms to 100ms</code>, while on a desktop machine with 8+ cores, the same benchmark improved from <code>100ms to 50ms</code>. Since the starting numbers of the released version also vary widely between machines, these results are only indicative.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="incremental-commits">Incremental commits<a href="https://cardano-scaling.org/monthly/2024-09#incremental-commits" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Incremental commits" title="Direct link to Incremental commits">‚Äã</a></h3>
<p>The incremental commits feature is being developed, and we demonstrated the envisioned user workflow during the monthly meeting.</p>
<p>Notably, users will first need to lock their UTXO in the Hydra deposit script. Once we have a signed snapshot on layer 2, the increment transaction will consume this output. Eventually, this will make the specified UTXO part of the head UTXO state on layer 2. In case of any issues, any Hydra node will be able to post a recovery transaction to unlock the UTXO.</p>
<p>The hydra-node API includes endpoints for depositing and recovering UTXOs, providing a convenient way to build and post these transactions. We aimed to create a user-friendly experience for these actions.</p>
<p>Next steps involve implementing comprehensive on-chain security, along with documentation and tutorials, to ensure our users understand how to use this new feature.
This is essential since many builders on Hydra have requested this feature.</p>

</ul>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="hydra-doom">Hydra Doom<a href="https://cardano-scaling.org/monthly/2024-08#hydra-doom" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Hydra Doom" title="Direct link to Hydra Doom">‚Äã</a></h3>
<p>At the Rare Evo event in Las Vegas, we showcased the Hydra Doom demo, a technology demonstration of Hydra where users could play the 1993 id software game Doom and for each frame of the game, a smart contract transaction was submitted to a Hydra head which recorded game state, user inputs, and validated game state transitions (as a proof of concept, using only some minor logic pertaining to the movement of the player and dying in-game).</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d897190d-ece6-4fa6-b0f0-ec214a58d0e2" alt="At Rare Evo" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<p>People could connect remotely via <a href="https://doom.hydra.family/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://doom.hydra.family</a> or in person on two custom-made arcade cabinets we had constructed for the occasion. Each game session contributed 35 transactions per second. In aggregate, we processed 106 million transactions with Hydra during the 78 hours of operation, which is more than the entire history of Cardano mainnet. The peak was around 7,200 tps.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f0b1430a-1cdf-4c48-839d-b6d217c8279a" alt="Last screen shot" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<p>The demo was very positively received on social media and seems to have rekindled the flames around the Hydra narrative both internally and externally, which hopefully bodes well for both future adoption interest among builders, as well as the prospects of securing funding for the continued development of Hydra from Intersect.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="network-tests-with-fault-injection">Network tests with fault injection<a href="https://cardano-scaling.org/monthly/2024-08#network-tests-with-fault-injection" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Network tests with fault injection" title="Direct link to Network tests with fault injection">‚Äã</a></h3>
<p>We have set up a simple yet effective <a href="https://github.com/cardano-scaling/hydra/blob/master/.github/workflows/network-test.yaml" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">workflow</a> capable of simulating a Hydra cluster under high transaction loads and packet loss network failures.</p>
<p>With this, we aim to consistently reproduce and resolve issues that are causing the head to become stuck, as outlined in <a href="https://github.com/cardano-scaling/hydra/issues/1436" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">#1436</a>.</p>
<p>The workflow specifies a set of high-load scenarios, each of which spins up the same Hydra cluster on <code>devnet</code> used during the <a href="https://hydra.family/head-protocol/docs/getting-started" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">getting started</a> tutorial and injects network faults using <a href="https://github.com/alexei-led/pumba" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pumba</a>.</p>
<p>The idea is to allow and encourage everyone to experiment with this workflow and collect summary results, which contain details about the performance within the head. Because these tests are performed with the <code>hydra-node</code> being a 'black box,' it also allows us to explore alternative network stacks as a whole.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="new-landing-page">New landing page<a href="https://cardano-scaling.org/monthly/2024-08#new-landing-page" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to New landing page" title="Direct link to New landing page">‚Äã</a></h3>
<p>For the Rare Evo event with the public Hydra doom demo (see above), we also figured it would be a good idea to improve the first impression new visitors get from the <a href="https://hydra.family/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://hydra.family</a> website.</p>
<p>The marketing team at IOG collaborated on creating new content and design for the landing page. In addition to highlighting the key features and explaining the importance of the Hydra Head protocol, the updated landing page also includes an analogy of how Hydra works, using a cargo plane as an example.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://cardano-scaling.org/assets/images/2024-08-hydra-landing-page-e72dc0867a7e6b6b4b2fe94087058b75.png" width="1636" height="1261" class="img_ev3q">
<small></small></p><center><small>Screenshot of the new landing page</small></center><p></p>

<p>After releasing the decommit feature that enables users to transfer funds from layer 2 to layer 1 while the head is operational, we quickly identified a bug. When a decommit is pending ( funds have not yet been withdrawn from the head) and a user attempts to create a new layer 2 transaction, the hydra-node attempts to re-apply the pending decommit to the local ledger state, resulting in an error.</p>
<p>We promptly realized that any pending decommit needs to match with the decommit in the new snapshot and should be preserved in the next snapshot(s) until it is observed. Without this fix, our decommit feature would be extremely fragile, so we made sure to quickly draft a failing <a href="https://github.com/cardano-scaling/hydra/pull/1540/files#diff-3479844ad82c0fd2f7af59c36f930cdb540876b9cf4201d67a41da83688500a9R440" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">test</a> and do a proper fix.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/cardano-scaling/hydra/pull/1540" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">This</a> is a pull request that fixes this bug and we also demonstrated this fix in one of our monthly meetings.</p>

<p>The monthly review meeting for August 2024 was held on 2024-08-28 via Google Meet,
presenting these <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/106NA1xtpuIcnC86HawBzpxY9VLexzOOxcfPD3dyoAg8" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">slides</a> and this <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Hi9AiI9cmIWXcN5xPTu3gl-KbyW-wm0K" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">recording</a>.</p>
<p>This month we saw demonstrations from both projects about new features and
improved testing capabilities. Optimization results and test results underline
the teams' commitment to evidence-based engineering. The Hydra Doom demo was a
great success and we received good feedback from users and use cases.</p>
<p>While roadmaps have not moved much over the last couple of months, but more
re-orientation is likely as plans for 2025 are coming together in the working
groups and other Intersect committees.</p>]]></content>

<p>We have planned to release two new distributions in August:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>2430</code> (before the <strong>Chang</strong> hardfork):<!-- -->
<ul>
<li>Activation of the certification of <strong>Cardano transactions</strong> in the <code>release-preprod</code> network.</li>
<li>Support for <strong>Cardano node</strong> <code>9.1.0</code> on <strong>all networks</strong>.</li>

<p>As Blockfrost now supports the Mithril endpoints within their API, they have presented an implementation example.</p>
<ul>
<li>The demo shows transaction verification within the Nami light wallet (using Blockfrost as its backend).</li>
<li>This allows the light wallet user to verify that their transaction is on-chain with the high certainty provided by Mithril security.</li>
<li>While it is just an experimental implementation, it might be accepted by the Nami upstream in the future.</li>
</ul>

<p>We have continued working on the implementation of the Cardano transaction certification with Mithril and are currently preparing for the rollout of this feature to production:</p>
<ul>
<li>We are finalizing the minimization of the signer footprint on the SPO infrastructure.</li>
<li>We are preparing for activating the feature in the <code>release-preprod</code> network with the following release.</li>
<li>We are preparing thorough documentation about the mechanism used to certify the transactions</li>
<li>We have selected final parameters for signing the transactions:<!-- -->
<ul>
<li><code>100</code> blocks from the tip of the chain (<code>~30 minutes</code>).</li>
<li><code>30</code> blocks between snapshots certifying the transactions (<code>~10 minutes</code>).</li>
<li>With these parameters, we can consider the transactions final with very high probability.</li>
<li>These parameters are hot parameters that can be adjusted without requiring a new distribution</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<p>We have been collaborating with the Cardano networking team to design a mechanism for implementing a decentralized message queue to decentralize the signature diffusion from Mithril signers to Mithril aggregators based on the Cardano network layer. The idea is to create a separate process for the decentralized message queue implementation:</p>
<ul>
<li>A new dedicated process (aka "Mithril network node") based on the Ouroboros network stack</li>
<li>More efficient handling of resource consumption (network and CPU) and reduced impact on the Cardano node performance and availability</li>
<li>Enhanced security with no impact on the Cardano node</li>
<li>Different release pace for both nodes</li>
<li>Both nodes will be bundled in the Cardano node distribution release</li>
<li>A hard fork for SPO registration of the port of their Mithril network node is likely needed.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>Completed incremental decommits, to be released separately as <code>0.18.0</code> after some remaining cleanup tasks and documentation updates</li>
<li>Release <code>0.19.0</code> will be incremental decommits and, depending on the hard-fork date of Cardano mainnet, switching to Conway on the Hydra L2 ledger (see <a href="https://cardano-scaling.org/monthly/2024-03#conway-support">March 2024</a> for more details)</li>

<p>This month we finally finished the implementation of the <a href="https://github.com/cardano-scaling/hydra/issues/1057" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Incremental decommit #1057</a> feature.</p>
<p>As evident from the GitHub feature description, the number of comments
and linked pull requests, this was a complex change.</p>
<p>Last month, we discussed why versioning the <code>open</code> state on-chain is necessary and the
subsequent changes to the specification and implementation. After addressing these in
<a href="https://github.com/cardano-scaling/hydra/issues/1473" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">hydra#1473</a> and in
<a href="https://github.com/cardano-scaling/hydra/issues/1474" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">hydra#1474</a>, a thorough
review and requiring tests for all changes (compared to <code>master</code>) in
<a href="https://github.com/cardano-scaling/hydra/issues/1483" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">hydra#1483</a> concluded in
a last cleanup PR, which made the feature consistent in specification,
implementation and documentation.</p>
<p>In the monthly review meeting we demonstrated the feature and the video below also shows how it works using a <a href="https://github.com/cardano-scaling/hydra/pull/1517" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">small extension</a> to the <code>hydra-tui</code>:</p>

<p>There were two Hydra working group meetings this month and multiple people showed interest in joining. Current member list can be found in the <a href="https://github.com/cardano-scaling/wg-hydra" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">charter</a> and meeting notes of all meetings are kept in <a href="https://github.com/cardano-scaling/wg-hydra/blob/main/meetings" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the repository</a> too.</p>
<p>The working group started work on the first item "What is Hydra Head V1" and
gathered valuable feedback in discussions between fellow layer 2 architects and
Hydra users.</p>
<p>Notable inputs were the need for an SDK, wallet integration and the ability to
operate without a full cardano-node, which got captured in
<a href="https://github.com/cardano-scaling/hydra/issues/1509" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">hydra#1509</a> and
<a href="https://github.com/cardano-scaling/hydra/issues/1305" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">hydra#1305</a> respectively. Even brand new ideas emerged from these discussions like "resumable Hydra heads".</p>
<p>The immediate goal is to achieve a common understanding of what must be included for a Hydra Head V1 and consequently when/how this could be audited?</p>
<p>Discussions also revolved around discoverability of Hydra heads, specifically, but also general interoperability with off-chain ledgers (any layer 2). In that regards, the group is considering to work on a <a href="https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">CPS/CIP</a> in the mid term.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="conclusion">Conclusion<a href="https://cardano-scaling.org/monthly/2024-07#conclusion" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Conclusion" title="Direct link to Conclusion">‚Äã</a></h2>
<p>The monthly review meeting for July 2024 was held on 2024-07-22 via Google Meet,
presenting these <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/17T18tNIJZPTiEfc2Psb1C6GRxt04hRNj16E5BiAML_I" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">slides</a> and this <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1sXYt1MZJtrq1jARha-MGLMWVORvSUjEv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">recording</a>.</p>
<p>Despite the likely impact of summer breaks on attendance, it was great to have Blockfrost demonstrate their experiments using Mithril certificates delivered through Blockfrost in a forked Nami version. This demo clearly illustrates how light clients can benefit from Mithril verifiable transactions.</p>
<p>On the Hydra side, we are very pleased to have successfully merged and prepared the incremental decommits feature for release. Although this process took some time, it marks the first substantial feature not originally covered by the Hydra head paper, demonstrating the protocol's capacity to grow and meet user needs. We appreciate all the valuable input from the Hydra working group regarding the features we should develop next and are excited to see the growing community interest in Hydra's future.</p>]]></content>

<p>We have released the new Mithril distribution <a href="https://github.com/input-output-hk/mithril/releases/tag/2423.0" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><code>2423.0</code></a>. This distribution includes several critical updates and enhancements:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>BREAKING</strong> changes in the <strong>Mithril client CLI</strong>:<!-- -->
<ul>
<li>The deprecated <code>snapshot</code> command has been <strong>removed</strong></li>
<li>It has been superseded by the <code>cardano-db</code> command</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Bug fixes and optimizations.</li>
</ul>
<p>We have also created a developer blog post about the <a href="https://mithril.network/doc/dev-blog/2024/06/12/client-cli-removed-command" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">removal of the Mithril client CLI 'snapshot' command</a>.</p>
<p>Additionally, we have released a draft version of the <a href="https://mithril.network/doc/mithril/threat-model" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Mithril threat model analysis</a>. We expect to receive external feedback and contributions before considering it final.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="transaction-certification">Transaction certification<a href="https://cardano-scaling.org/monthly/2024-06#transaction-certification" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Transaction certification" title="Direct link to Transaction certification">‚Äã</a></h3>
<p>We kept working on the implementation of the Cardano transaction certification with Mithril and made good progress with the development:</p>
<ul>
<li>Transactions are now retrieved with the chain sync mini-protocol using the <a href="https://github.com/txpipe/pallas" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><code>Pallas</code></a> library</li>
<li>The performance of the prover route of the aggregator has significantly improved.</li>
</ul>

<p>The transactions are imported using the native chain sync mini-protocol of the Cardano node. This has been made possible with the Pallas library, which fully supports this mini-protocol. This allowed us to retrieve transactions much closer to the tip of the chain and at more frequent intervals. To achieve this, we have enhanced the transaction importer to handle chain rollbacks, where some blocks previously recorded may be discarded at a later time, with an increased probability as we get closer to the tip of the chain.</p>
<p>We are currently calibrating the system parameters (depth from the tip and certification pace) before activating it on the mainnet.</p>

<p>We have identified some bottlenecks in the computations of the merkelized proof for transaction membership of the transaction set as well as in the database access. These bottlenecks have been fixed, allowing us to achieve a new order of magnitude in the performance of the prover route. It is now able to consistently deliver <strong>10,000</strong> transaction hashes certification per second.</p>

<p>We have been working with the Cardano networking team to design a closer integration of Mithril into Cardano. In particular, we have focused on decentralizing the signature diffusion from Mithril signers to Mithril aggregators based on the Cardano network layer.</p>
<p>Here is the current roadmap:</p>
<ul>
<li>Assessing Cardano network bandwidth capacity to support Mithril signature diffusion</li>
<li>Designing a node-to-node mini-protocol for signature diffusion</li>
<li>Designing two node-to-client mini-protocols for signature submission and notification</li>
<li>Preparing the submission of a CIP draft to the community.</li>

<p>Here is a high-level overview of the team's work over the past month:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Incremental decommits.</strong> We continued our work on incremental decommits, focusing on investigating adversarial attacks on the head script contract.</li>
<li><strong>Specification update.</strong> We updated our <a href="https://github.com/input-output-hk/hydra/pull/1479" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">specification</a> with the latest changes following our exploration of adversarial attacks. These updates aim to enhance the security of the protocol.</li>
<li><strong>Agda specification for the Hydra protocol.</strong> Work has begun on writing an Agda specification for the Hydra protocol. You can follow the progress <a href="https://github.com/cardano-scaling/hydra-formal-specification" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Incremental commit.</strong> We discussed various options for the incremental commit work, including potential designs for a hydra-ledger to improve system efficiency and security.</li>
<li><strong>Node compatibility.</strong> The node has been successfully updated and is now compatible with cardano-node version 8.11-pre.</li>
<li><strong>Website.</strong> We updated our website tutorials and documentation to enhance expressivity and ease of use.</li>
<li><strong>Committing internal wallet UTXOs.</strong> We made breaking changes to the <code>hydra-node</code> API <code>/commit</code> endpoint <a href="https://github.com/input-output-hk/hydra/pull/1463" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">#1463</a> to remove the check that prevented committing UTXOs from an internal <code>hydra-node</code> wallet.</li>
</ul>
<p>We have not planned the next release, so our roadmap remains largely unchanged. Our current focus is on incremental decommits and commits and specifying our protocol in Agda.</p>

<p>We were about to release the incremental decommit feature when we discovered a bug during a demo. This bug related to handling the decommit snapshot in close/fanout. When one decided to decommit funds from the head and everyone signed the decommit snapshot, the same snapshot was used to close/fanout. If this snapshot contained some UTXOs to decommit but one already decommitted funds from the head, the fanout would distribute the decommit funds again.</p>
<p>This issue was significant, and although we have many tests around the decommit feature, we had not checked user balances upon head closure.</p>
<p>We have implemented a fix that involves adding versioned snapshots. This allows us to distinguish between two cases:</p>
<ul>
<li>The decommit snapshot was signed, but the decommit was never observed</li>
<li>The decommit snapshot was signed, and the decommit was also observed.</li>
</ul>
<p>When we observe the decommit transaction locally, we increment the version in the local state. This allows us to compare the snapshot version against the expected local version on-chain.</p>
<p>We also needed to keep extra data in the <code>Close</code> redeemer to successfully check for a valid snapshot signature while altering the close datum to remove the UTXOs to decommit if the versions do not match. This ensures that the fanout behaves correctly, as it is only concerned with the close datum and the actual transaction output hashes.</p>
<p>The remaining work involves updating the specification with the changes in the implementation. We expect to release this feature in the coming days.</p>

<p>Algy Wallis presented 'Subbit', a layer 2 solution focused on subscription-based services, aimed at addressing the complexities of building blockchain products. Subbit is designed to be easier to integrate and manage compared to layer 1 solutions, reducing latency and transaction fees. The system allows providers to verify consumer IOU notes, facilitating periodic payments and withdrawals with minimal on-chain interactions. This model mirrors Bitcoin's Lightning Network and aims to enhance scalability and interoperability for subscription services on Cardano.</p>

<p>George Flerovsky introduced the Hydrazoa proposal, currently in Catalyst Fund12. Hydrazoa aims to enhance the existing Hydra framework by adding dynamic capabilities for incremental commits and decommits, along with the ability to add or remove participants in state channels while they are still open. The goal is to simplify layer 1 scripts and lower costs, with fallback mechanisms similar to Hydra's in case of layer 2 consensus failure. George highlighted the differences and potential integrations with Hydra, emphasizing a more flexible and simplified approach to state channel management.</p>

<p>Reza Baram provided an update on the Hydra working group, which recently had its first meeting to discuss its vision and collaborative processes. The primary goal is to create an environment for sharing knowledge and working towards scaling Cardano beyond just Hydra. The group is currently focused on defining and delivering Hydra version one, prioritizing incremental commits and robustness improvements. Feedback from the community and working group members will be sought to refine and enhance the roadmap, ensuring effective scaling solutions for Cardano applications. The Hydra working group is open to new members and contributions from the community. <a href="https://github.com/cardano-scaling/wg-hydra" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Read more here</a>.</p>

<p>We have released the new Mithril distribution <a href="https://github.com/input-output-hk/mithril/releases/tag/2418.1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><code>2418.1</code></a>. This distribution includes several critical updates and enhancements:</p>
<ul>
<li>A <strong>breaking change</strong> introduced in the <strong>Mithril client / Mithril client CLI</strong>:<!-- -->
<ul>
<li>The certificate chain structure has been modified to remove coupling with the immutable file number</li>
<li>The client <strong>must be updated</strong> to verify the certificate chain</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>We have switched the <strong>memory allocator</strong> to <code>jemallocator</code> on the signer and the aggregator to avoid memory fragmentation</li>
<li>We have enabled the BLST <code>portable</code> feature by default to benefit from <strong>runtime check</strong> of intel ADX instruction set.</li>
</ul>
<p>Also, we have started the process of removing the deprecated <code>snapshot</code> command from the client which is superseded by the <code>cardano-db</code> command. This <strong>change will be effective</strong> with the release of the next Mithril distribution.</p>

<p>We have kept working on the implementation of the Cardano transactions certification with Mithril and we have achieved a new milestone with running the certification in a test network (aka <code>testing-mainnet</code>) which operates on the Cardano <code>mainnet</code>.</p>
<p>This allowed us to refine our roadmap with clear objectives before the MVP can be released:</p>
<ul>
<li>Keep working on the low latency implementation of the certification</li>
<li>Optimize the aggregator prover route to reach good throughput</li>
<li>Optimize the signer footprint to limit the impact on the SPO infrastructure</li>
<li>Optimize the signer and aggregator warmup to avoid network instability/disruption once the MVP is released.</li>
</ul>

<p>A first optimization of the prover route has been implemented, drastically improving performance. By implementing resource pooling on the Merkle tree that signs transactions by block range, we have achieved a <strong>100x</strong> increase in throughput.</p>

<p>We have also implemented a pruning mechanism on the signer that retains only the transactions needed to compute upcoming signatures. This has reduced the storage requirements from <strong>32GB</strong> to <strong>100MB</strong>.</p>

<p>This month, Hydra version <code>0.17.0</code> was released which includes</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>breaking changes of the <code>/commit</code> endpoint, yielding full flexibility when committing from scripts (see <a href="https://hydra.family/head-protocol/docs/how-to/commit-blueprint" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this how-to</a> for details)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>new <code>GET /snapshot/utxo</code> HTTP endpoint</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>detecting network protocol mismatches</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://github.com/input-output-hk/hydra/releases/tag/0.17.0" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Full release notes</a> and a list of <a href="https://github.com/input-output-hk/hydra/milestone/18?closed=1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">delivered features</a></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Besides corresponding features being released through <code>0.17.0</code>, the roadmap did not change much this month. Current focus is on incremental decommits and commits, while we also wait for the <code>Conway</code> hard-fork to happen before we can switch the L2 ledger also to <code>Conway</code> (see <a href="https://cardano-scaling.org/monthly/2024-03#conway-support">March report</a> for more details).</p>

<p>In the process of implementing the incremental decommits feature, we constantly considered how to ensure our test suite covered all potential scenarios. For example, what happens if we request a decommit, have a signed snapshot, but never post a decommit transaction? Or how do we handle close and fanout with decommit UTXO in the snapshot? There are various scenarios we are interested in testing, and we quickly realized that we would need to test at different levels to achieve the coverage we expect, especially for our on-chain code.</p>
<p>Our mutation test suite was also very helpful in testing whether our on-chain code produces the expected errors when manipulating the transaction to make it invalid. However, this framework tests individual transactions, and we needed to test if multiple transactions in sequence produce valid results.</p>
<p>To address this, we decided to utilize quickcheck-dynamic once again to model simple snapshots, which are used to construct Hydra transactions. Our hope was that if the model is simple enough, we would be able to reason about it without delving into many details and decide if a particular UTXO/snapshot should be valid in the current transaction context or not. In the quickcheck-dynamic world, our 'Action' contains snapshots, which are then used to construct different transactions, evaluate, and observe them. Our model keeps the extra information we need to evaluate these transactions, and all snapshots are signed by everybody to keep things simple.</p>
<p>This test suite has already exposed some bugs we had and enabled us to reason about our code using a simpler model without burdening us with real-world details, which are more involved and harder to reason about.</p>

<p>Catalyst Fund12 is in full swing, with over 30 proposals this round mentioning 'Hydra' in one way or another. While some directly draw inspiration from Hydra and tackle similar challenges, others aim to enhance transaction processing scalability but take different approaches (such as rollups and sidechains). Additionally, some proposals focus solely on scaling payment transactions, offering refreshingly simple solutions.</p>
<p>After a quick screening, we also engaged with some of the proposal authors this month to address questions about Hydra, discuss similarities, and explore opportunities for mutual learning and collaboration:</p>

<li>
<p><a href="https://cardano.ideascale.com/c/idea/121983" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Wine Supply Chain Tracking and Reporting System</a>. Great use case that requires the seamless integration of recording data as transactions off-chain, with resulting states and tokens accessible from the Cardano layer 1. The team is already developing a proof of concept using Hydra, and this proposal aims to advance it into a minimum viable product (MVP).</p>

<li><a href="https://cardano.ideascale.com/c/idea/120893" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Hydra-Enabled Micropayments System</a>. The same team behind the wine supply chain tracking system wants to also provide a decentralized payment system that offers great point-of-sales experience using Hydra at its core.

<li><a href="https://cardano.ideascale.com/c/idea/123375" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Open-source Hydra Head L2 Web-based Explorer and API</a>. Improving the visibility of what's going on in a Hydra Head is a great idea.

<p>As the age of Voltaire unfolds, it fosters the formation of community alliances and member-based organizations. At the same time, there's a popular belief that governance over core Cardano projects should become more open, with decisions regarding the inclusion or exclusion of elements on the roadmap of core infrastructure being transparent.</p>
<p>The current strategy devised by Intersect and its members to address this involves establishing technical working groups that operate openly and transparently on roadmaps and high-level backlog items. This approach mirrors what we're already doing here (see also last
months <a href="https://cardano-scaling.org/monthly/2024-04#starmap-update">starmap update</a>
section), but with a more concrete democratic approach to ratifying a roadmap. Presently, roadmaps for both Hydra and Mithril projects are expected to be governed in this manner.</p>
<p>Specifically for the Hydra working group, initial steps were taken this month by drafting a barebones charter and brainstorming first agenda items to engage potential members and get first sessions going as we gather more interested stakeholders. The charter and any future outputs of the working group will be
hosted on <a href="https://github.com/cardano-scaling/wg-hydra" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><code>cardano-scaling/wg-hydra</code></a> and we
also <a href="https://intersect.gitbook.io/intersect-working-groups/technical-working-groups/hydra" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">registered the working group at
Intersect</a>.</p>

<p>The monthly review meeting for May 2024 was held on 2024-05-28 via Google Meet,
presenting these <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1ByOgQt6gEjOY9Wd-xOMzeSy4lfQmMn39KEtSB-VisVw/edit#slide=id.g21194f9c145_0_5" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">slides</a> and this <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Y_xa9JjQ62m98m5MC27NDbsSjVjspnsA/view" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">recording</a>.</p>
<p>May was a short month because of the public holidays and some people being off, but we still made good progress on both projects. The new dashboards for Mithril will visualize existing participation and surely garner more interest in the protocol. We are also excited about the progress on the Cardano transactions certification with Mithril, especially as multiple projects building bridges or layer 2s are keeping a close eye on this feature.</p>
<p>While we are busy on the Hydra side wrapping our head around incremental decommits and ensuring they are correctly implemented through transaction trace testing, we are also excited about the upcoming Catalyst Fund12 proposals and the discussions coming along with it as others are also looking into building similar, yet different scaling solutions and tackle the same challenges.</p>
<p>We are also making progress on making Hydra and Mithril less IOG-driven, but more community-owned through working groups and Intersect. We are excited to see how this will turn out.</p>]]></content>

<p>As a part of our strategy to increase the participation in the Mithril protocol we have been reaching out to SPO's who don't yet run a Mithril signer, providing them with the support they need to set up and run their signer. We appreciate the SPO's such as Cardano Foundation who took the step in joining the protocol. As of epoch 481, the number of stake pools registered in the Mithril protocol as signers has reached 258. This represents approximately 5 billion ADA, which is approximately 22% of Cardano's active stake.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://cardano-scaling.org/assets/images/2024-04-mithril-participation-e94b95c6456f0097259d1350b014b9ef.png" width="630" height="377" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<p>We have prepared the pre-release of the new Mithril distribution <a href="https://github.com/input-output-hk/mithril/releases/tag/2418.1-pre" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><code>2418.1-pre</code></a>. This release includes several critical updates and enhancements:</p>
<ul>
<li>A <strong>breaking change</strong> is introduced in <strong>Mithril client / Mithril client CLI</strong>:<!-- -->
<ul>
<li>The certificate chain structure has been modified to remove coupling with immutable file number.</li>
<li>The client <strong>must be updated</strong> to verify certificate chain.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>We have switched the <strong>memory allocator</strong> to <code>jemallocator</code> on the signer and the aggregator to avoid memory fragmentation.</li>
<li>We have enabled the BLST <code>portable</code> feature by default in order to benefit from <strong>runtime check</strong> of intel ADX instruction set.</li>
</ul>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="signer-registration-decentralization-poc">Signer registration decentralization PoC<a href="https://cardano-scaling.org/monthly/2024-04#signer-registration-decentralization-poc" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Signer registration decentralization PoC" title="Direct link to Signer registration decentralization PoC">‚Äã</a></h3>
<p>We have kept working on the decentralization experiments for Mithril networks. The <strong>signature diffusion</strong> decentralization has already been implemented in a previous proof-of-concept, and we have created a new proof-of-concept for decentralizing the <strong>signer registration process</strong>.</p>
<p>In order to do so, we have created a new <strong>peer-to-peer pubsub topic</strong> using <code>libp2p</code> and adapted the <strong>relay</strong> so that:</p>
<ul>
<li>When a <strong>signer relay</strong> receives a signer registration from a signer, it broadcasts it to the new P2P topic.</li>
<li>When an <strong>aggregator relay</strong> receives a new signer registration from the P2P topic, it calls back the aggregator with it.</li>
<li>A <strong>repeater mechanism</strong> has been implemented so that a <strong>signer relay</strong> sends the signer registration multiple times during an epoch (at regular pace) to prevent missed messages.</li>
</ul>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://cardano-scaling.org/assets/images/2024-04-mithril-p2p-signer-registration-poc-78edc59c4b4f2ade8ef38c7fb4fdc836.jpg" width="1336" height="748" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<p>We don't need strong guarantees or consensus for the diffusion of signatures: different aggregators can create valid multi-signatures from different subsets of individual signatures as long as the quorum is reached. We could also implement the repeater mechanism so that a signature is broadcast a few times in order to prevent missed messages and reach more aggregators.</p>
<p>However, we need stronger guarantees for the signer registration: in order to create a valid multi-signature a <strong>minimum number</strong> of signers and aggregators must use <strong>exactly the same set of signer registrations</strong> (enough signers and aggregators so that the individual signatures created allow to reach the quorum). In case of a partition, the network could get in a situation where the quorum is never reached during an epoch: this would lead to a gap in the certification and the security of the protocol could not be guaranteed. Adversarial behaviors from some signers could for example be responsible for such partitions. Moreover, with the current design, as the number of aggregators is much lower than the number of signers, the risk of partition could be even higher.</p>
<p>This will lead us to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Reach for a consensus or quasi-consensus for the signer registrations.</li>
<li>Adapt the topology of the network so that there are approximately the same number of signers and aggregators (i.e. all signers are also aggregators) or modify the aggregation process so that aggregators don't verify the message that is certified.</li>
</ul>
<p>The next steps for the decentralization of Mithril networks are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Draft a CIP for leveraging the Cardano network layer and implement mini-protocols that will operate the diffusion of messages in a pubsub topic.</li>
<li>Draft a CPS for stating the problem about signer registration.</li>
<li>Get some feedback from the community, feel free to contribute!</li>

<p>This month, the <a href="https://github.com/orgs/input-output-hk/projects/21/views/7" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">roadmap</a> received updates to reflect an upcoming <code>0.17.0</code> release, which will include several API updates and two notable features:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/input-output-hk/hydra/issues/1350" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Revise <code>POST /commit</code> endpoint interface #1350</a> and</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/input-output-hk/hydra/issues/1010" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Use versioned handshake when connecting hydra-nodes #1010</a></li>
</ul>
<p>The latter was distilled out of the much broader and long-standing <a href="https://github.com/input-output-hk/hydra/issues/191" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Hydra node software, scripts &amp; protocol updates #191</a> as it was the last actionable piece of the included scenarios on how to handle change. Having this will make the <code>hydra-node</code> detect incompatible network protocols and improve robustness of the node implementation.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" alt="The roadmap with features and ideas" src="https://cardano-scaling.org/assets/images/2024-04-hydra-roadmap-6ef0ee03b520c438f447eb831738db1c.jpg" width="5916" height="2704" class="img_ev3q">
<small></small></p><center><small>The latest roadmap with features and ideas</small></center><p></p>
<p>Besides feature ideas which are to be discussed and refined in the upcoming weeks, our focus lies on the two major features of incremental commits and decommits are currently being worked on by the team.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="why-are-incremental-commits-hard">Why are incremental commits hard?<a href="https://cardano-scaling.org/monthly/2024-04#why-are-incremental-commits-hard" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Why are incremental commits hard?" title="Direct link to Why are incremental commits hard?">‚Äã</a></h3>
<p>Both, <a href="https://github.com/input-output-hk/hydra/issues/1057" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Incremental decommit #1057</a> and <a href="https://github.com/input-output-hk/hydra/issues/199" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Incremental commit #199</a> turned out to be non-trivial and are in progress still.</p>
<p>While the plan is clear by now (see issue comments for a history), changes to the protocol are substantial and can be considered literally Hydra Head V2 (but any change to the scripts is a major change). Currently, the off-chain workflow is mostly implemented end-to-end, but the on-chain part is still in the works and requires a lot more testing.</p>
<p>As these features will allow to update the <code>Open</code> state on-chain, rollbacks and interleavings of so-called <code>increment</code>, <code>decrement</code> and the <code>close</code> transactions need to be considered. This is a complex problem that requires a lot of testing and validation to ensure that the protocol is secure and correct.</p>
<p>In particular, we need to be testing (ideally proving) that:</p>
<ul>
<li>funds already committed / not yet decommitted are always returned (completeness)</li>
<li>funds are never returned twice (soundness)</li>
<li>the head can process transactions throughout (liveness)</li>
</ul>
<p>Our approach to testing is similar to when we implemented the basic protocol: end-to-end tests ensure overall integration, while property-based mutation tests ensure individual validators work correctly. This time, however, we are also looking at stateful property-based testing of <em>many</em> sequences of transactions (see <a href="https://github.com/input-output-hk/hydra/issues/1390" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this task</a> and <a href="https://github.com/input-output-hk/hydra/blob/feature/incremental-decommit/hydra-node/test/Hydra/Chain/Direct/TxTraceSpec.hs" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this module</a> on the <code>feature/incremental-decommit</code> branch).</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="hydra-commit-endpoint-enhancements">Hydra /commit endpoint enhancements<a href="https://cardano-scaling.org/monthly/2024-04#hydra-commit-endpoint-enhancements" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Hydra /commit endpoint enhancements" title="Direct link to Hydra /commit endpoint enhancements">‚Äã</a></h3>
<p>We are about to release a refactor on the <code>/commit</code> endpoint which provides greater control for drafting commit txs, allowing for adjustments to the transaction context, which is crucial for real-world scenarios involving transaction validity checks, required signers, etc.</p>
<p>This refactor changes the endpoint to now accept a "blueprint" tx, CBOR-encoded, along with the UTxO, JSON-encoded.
The UTxO is used to resolve inputs spent in the transaction, and the "blueprint tx" serves as the foundation for creating the resulting drafted commit tx, retaining anything that complies with the requirements of a valid head commit transaction.</p>
<p>This enhancement was initiated following a discussion led by the MLabs team, as documented <a href="https://github.com/input-output-hk/hydra/discussions/1337" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>. The need arose to unblock a <a href="https://github.com/mlabs-haskell/hydra-auction-onchain/blob/95fae061a4a50a635007a7e228443080f8141570/src/HydraAuctionOnchain/Validators/StandingBid.hs#L139-L157" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">sub-validator</a> utilized in the hydra-auction for checking spending conditions to move a standing bid to L2. The discussion was promptly converted into an <a href="https://github.com/input-output-hk/hydra/issues/1350" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">issue</a> and subsequently added to our roadmap after internal grooming by the Hydra team.</p>
<p>While this refactor represents a breaking change, the hydra-node can still be utilized as before if the provided UTxO is at a public key address. However, to spend from a script UTxO and unlock more complex use-cases, users must provide an additional unsigned transaction that accurately specifies required data, such as redeemers and validity ranges.</p>

<p>This month the who-is-who of Cardano builders got lured to Toulouse, France for a two-day tech-only conference. It was a great occasion to meet fellow contributors and build bridges (literally) to new projects and their creators.</p>
<p>Two of many notable presentations and how they relate to the Hydra and Mithril projects are detailed as contributed by Pi (Sundae Labs) and Sebastian (Cardano Foundation).</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="ibc-bridge">IBC bridge<a href="https://cardano-scaling.org/monthly/2024-04#ibc-bridge" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to IBC bridge" title="Direct link to IBC bridge">‚Äã</a></h3>
<p>Cardano Foundation has started to work on an implementation of the Inter Blockchain Communication protocol (<a href="https://github.com/cosmos/ibc" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">IBC</a>) to allow builders to connect other blockchains to the Cardano network that also implement IBC like e.g. <a href="https://docs.cosmos.network/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Cosmos SDK</a> or <a href="https://docs.substrate.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Substrate</a> based blockchains. Whereas IBC has many similarities with other communication protocols like e.g. TCP and is based on the pretty straight forward delivery of data packets from one blockchain to the other by so called Relayers the general security model is based on the assumption that the consensus of both blockchains to be connected can be trusted. The latter resolves in the challenge that so called Light Clients need to be implemented that allow one network to check the validity of the consensus of the other, to verify if a specific operation like e.g. the locking of certain assets has been done as communicated via IBC. This typically implies that a blockchain network is able to generate so called state proofs that can be presented to the Light Client which then is able to perform the validation.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the Cardano blockchain does not generate such state proofs as the underlying architecture and Ouroboros consensus do not rely on such a primitive. This leads to the the challenge that implementing a Light Client purely based on available data from the consensus (e.g. block data) has several shortcomings with regards to security or if traded for it liveness of the client causing significant latency in the message delivery between both networks (as the Light Client would have to wait until a sequence of blocks is presented for validation), which is not a feasible option for a real world production deployment.</p>
<p>However, there are other networks out there with a similar setup in that specific regard that recently claimed to have implemented IBC like e.g. <a href="https://docs.picasso.network/technology/ibc/solana/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Solana</a>. Their approach is based on overlay networks that take care of collecting additional signatures from network validators for state proof data (like blocks, transactions, etc.) increasing the trustworthiness of those proofs. Fortunately, there is a similar solution currently under development in the Cardano ecosystem, which is Mithril.</p>
<p>The Cardano Foundation Engineering team has recently concluded the first phase of the IBC implementation demonstrating the technical feasibility of connecting Cardano to a Cosmos SDK based blockchain taking the disadvantages mentioned above into account. The work has been made public in a repository that can be found here: <a href="https://github.com/cardano-foundation/cardano-ibc-incubator" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://github.com/cardano-foundation/cardano-ibc-incubator</a></p>
<p>In a second phase that is scheduled to run from April till roughly beginning of July the team is working on replacing the existing supposedly weak Light Client implementation of the Ouroboros consensus on the Cosmos based blockchain with a Light Client that leverages the functionalities of Mithril. As a first approach we are intending to use specifically a recently introduced method that allows to check if a specific transaction is part of the global set of transactions of the network.</p>

<p>Gummiworm is a low-divergence fork of the Hydra node being built by Sundae Labs, which teases apart execution and custody; By sacrificing some control over the opening and closing of heads, it dramatically strengthens the security model specifically in the case when non-head participants are transacting in the head.</p>
<p>At Buidler-fest, we demo'd a very early, duct-tape and bubble-gum demo of depositing into a smart contract, minting those funds in the hydra head, and achieving auditability of the transactions in the head.</p>
<p>We also spoke about our longer term plans, such as changes to the ledger to accommodate a better user experience, and making the custody model "plug and play", so you could provide different mechanisms for different use cases.</p>

<p>Every now and then, roughly quarterly, we like to take a step back from individual project roadmaps and think on an even higher level of what should be the priorities for the next couple months.</p>
<p>This time, the themes we would like to focus on are <em>open governance</em>, <em>use cases and adoption</em>, as well as <em>measure and visualize</em>. Across Hydra and Mithril we believe the following items, which ideally are backed by technical features on individual roadmaps, are suitable next steps:</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://cardano-scaling.org/assets/images/2024-04-starmap-205c6728ee094d3673b24d6705da3441.jpg" width="1571" height="636" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<p>As one can see from past quarters, opening up the governance of scalability projects is a recurring theme and of highest priority. Ironically, the proposed work items above were mostly shaped and prioritised in private discussions between IOI and PaloIT. We will need to open discussions of what is valuable to build, to gather feedback and ensure individual projects tie into a compelling and <em>fundable</em> portfolio across the whole ecosystem.</p>
<p>A first glimpse of this already happened at the Buidler Fest where a spontaneous (open space) session on "the future of Hydra and Mithril" spawned great interest and new ideas like</p>
<ul>
<li>Shallow node would be interesting</li>
<li>Once per epoch Mithril-signed ledger state</li>
<li>BLS accumulators for Hydra partial fanout; also relevant for Mithril?</li>
<li>The need for another audit of latest Hydra Head protocol</li>
</ul>
<p>As also listed on the starmap, a logical next step is to create an open working group with interested experts from the Cardano community. A working group to discuss whether and how a Hydra Tail protocol should be built out? What it would entail (pun intended)? Built by whom? How would it relate to Gummiworm, Cosmex, Subbit, zkFold, ... which should maybe prioritised by the Cardano community instead?</p>

<p>The monthly review meeting for April 2024 was held on 2024-04-30 via Google Meet,
presenting these <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1GwABNDvdFFF7LlgIlycyLsQub0Btd9XvwpgEYPrGQ9I/edit#slide=id.g1f87a7454a5_0_1392" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">slides</a> and this <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/15wQ3hTWv9qDAxt7mjA1YXGKKutS-nG_k/view" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">recording</a>.</p>
<p>While we saw some demos on Mithril and Hydra projects' progress, the real highlight this month was the Cardano Buidler Fest with its many great talks and discussions - often involving scalability limitations and technology to overcome it. Exciting discussions around zero knowledge primitives, infrastructure projects, and open source likely inspired everyone attending to keep building and improving Cardano.</p>
<p>There is still some uncertainty in how exactly governance of Hydra and Mithril can be made more open, collaborating on consistent high-level plans across multiple projects in the realm of improving Cardano scalability. However, we might have found with <a href="https://cardano-scaling.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">cardano-scaling.org</a> a welcoming home not only for Hydra and Mithril, but for contributors and projects from various backgrounds, while first steps of involving the community more actively in a Hydra working group at Intersect are being made.</p>
<p>Besides this, the monthly review meeting held some sneak peeks of a new paper on fresh scalability tech (Ouroboros Leios) and fun conversations on games and other great ways to potentially show off a definite Hydra V1 at Rare Evo this summer - "Can it run doom?" üòà.</p>]]></content>

<p>This month, there has been a noticeable increase in SPOs joining the Mithril protocol. In particular, many new multi-pool operators have set up the Mithril signer in their infrastructure. At the end of epoch <strong>#475</strong>, there were <strong>230</strong> pools registered with <strong>4.6B‚Ç≥</strong> stake involved representing approximately 20% of the total active stake. We will continue to provide regular updates to the community to encourage their participation in the protocol.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://cardano-scaling.org/assets/images/2024-03-mithril-participation-77cfd3b9237a0e17e2babf6aad914e15.png" width="781" height="466" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<p>We have released the new Mithril distribution <a href="https://github.com/input-output-hk/mithril/releases/tag/2412.0" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><code>2412.0</code></a>. This release includes several critical updates and enhancements, such as support for Prometheus metrics endpoint in signer, deprecation of the <code>snapshot</code> command in the client CLI, full Pallas based implementation of the chain observer, and support for Cardano node version <code>8.9.0</code>.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="transaction-signatures">Transaction signatures<a href="https://cardano-scaling.org/monthly/2024-03#transaction-signatures" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Transaction signatures" title="Direct link to Transaction signatures">‚Äã</a></h3>
<p>We have developed a signing structure that enables quick proof generation while maintaining a light footprint on the signer for the <code>mainnet</code>. This is crucial as we need to handle a vast amount of transactions (100 million). To achieve this, we created a <strong>block range Merkle tree</strong>, which stores transactions in a Merkle tree and uses its root to create another Merkle tree. According to the our benchmark tests, a batch proof for <code>100</code> transactions can now be created in less than <code>250 ms</code>.</p>

<p>We have also completed the roadmap of the MVP that will be released on <code>mainnet</code>:</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://cardano-scaling.org/assets/images/2024-03-mithril-cardano-tx-roadmap-c38ffa89357d117598610d1836a50526.png" width="793" height="808" class="img_ev3q"></p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/@mithril-dev/mithril-client-wasm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Mithril client WASM library</a> has been used to implement a Cardano transaction verifier inside the <a href="https://mithril.network/explorer/?aggregator=https%3A%2F%2Faggregator.testing-sanchonet.api.mithril.network%2Faggregator" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Mithril explorer</a>.
This feature is currently available only on the <code>testing-sanchonet</code> network and will be progressively rolled out to the other Mithril networks.
Wallet and DApp developers could leverage the client WASM library to implement a security layer that verifies transactions provided by a third party.</p>

<p>We have released a new Prometheus endpoint with the latest stable version of the signer. The feature can be easily activated by the SPOs as explained in this <a href="https://mithril.network/doc/dev-blog/2024/03/26/mithril-signer-prometheus-endpoint" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">developer blog post</a>.</p>
<p>Additionally, we created a Grafana template to easily set up a dashboard for this Prometheus endpoint: <a href="https://grafana.com/grafana/dashboards/20776-mithril-signer/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://grafana.com/grafana/dashboards/20776-mithril-signer/</a></p>

<p>The latest stable distribution now includes a fully implemented chain observer powered by the <a href="https://crates.io/crates/pallas" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><code>pallas</code></a> crate. Additionally, we have been collaborating with TxPipe to implement the <code>chainsync</code> mini-protocol with Pallas. This will significantly reduce the latency of signatures for Cardano transactions.</p>

<p>We recommend using the replacement <code>cardano-db snapshot</code> command for users of the client CLI.</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Evolved the user-requested <a href="https://github.com/input-output-hk/hydra/discussions/1337" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">feature idea #1337</a> into a new feature on the roadmap to <a href="https://github.com/input-output-hk/hydra/issues/1350" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">revise POST /commit endpoint interface #1350</a>. This will allow committing into a head directly from advanced smart contracts. It remains unclear whether this will be part of the upcoming <code>0.16.0</code> release.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Captured the new feature idea of <a href="https://github.com/input-output-hk/hydra/issues/1329" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Directly open heads #1329</a> as item on the roadmap. This requires further grooming and could supersede other ideas like <a href="https://github.com/input-output-hk/hydra/issues/699" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Always abortable head #699</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Mostly completed <a href="https://github.com/input-output-hk/hydra/issues/1213" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Drop support for JSON encoded transactions #1213</a> and <a href="https://github.com/input-output-hk/hydra/issues/1325" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Streaming plugins #1325</a>, which will be released soon as <code>0.16.0</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Made substantial progress on <a href="https://github.com/input-output-hk/hydra/issues/1057" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Incremental decommit #1057</a>, however, this is unlikely to be released as part of <code>0.16.0</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fully prepared <a href="https://github.com/input-output-hk/hydra/issues/1178" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Switch L2 ledger to Conway #1178</a>, such that it can be released directly after the hard fork on the Cardano layer 1.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>As we improve our understanding of pivotal features such as incremental commits and decommits, the feature set required to address [known issues and limitations] (<a href="https://hydra.family/head-protocol/docs/known-issues/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://hydra.family/head-protocol/docs/known-issues/</a>) is being narrowed down, and the scope for a convincing version <code>1.0.0</code> is becoming clearer.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="conway-support">Conway support<a href="https://cardano-scaling.org/monthly/2024-03#conway-support" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Conway support" title="Direct link to Conway support">‚Äã</a></h3>
<p>As mentioned in previous roadmap updates, we separated work to support the upcoming Conway era on Cardano in two:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/input-output-hk/hydra/issues/1177" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Conway support #1177</a> will make the <code>hydra-node</code> support Conway and allow users to keep heads open across the hard fork.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/input-output-hk/hydra/issues/1178" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Drop Babbage support #1178</a> will eventually drop support for the Babbage era and retain maintainability.</li>
</ul>
<p>While the former was already merged and is currently released in version <code>0.15.0</code> onwards, the team prepared the latter this month.</p>
<p>Ideally switching the transaction format in the <code>hydra-node</code> is as simple as setting the type alias <code>type Era = Conway</code>. However, the code was <code>Babbage</code>-specific in several areas and work on this resulted in various pull requests making switching easier in several places: <a href="https://github.com/input-output-hk/hydra/pull/1326" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">#1326</a>, <a href="https://github.com/input-output-hk/hydra/pull/1327" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">#1327</a>, <a href="https://github.com/input-output-hk/hydra/pull/1328" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">#1328</a>, <a href="https://github.com/input-output-hk/hydra/pull/1334" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">#1334</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/input-output-hk/hydra/pull/1342" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">#1342</a>.</p>
<p>The result is a relatively simple switch in this <a href="https://github.com/input-output-hk/hydra/pull/1338" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">draft pull request</a> and available on branch <code>lc/conway-support</code>, which we intend to bump and merge once the public Cardano networks hard fork.</p>
<p>Having full <code>Conway</code> era support, including <code>PlutusV3</code>, on the Hydra layer 2 already prepared on a branch allows early adopting users from the community to explore and use this already. Modulo-P has been on the forefront here by developing zero-knowledge hybrid DApps and wrapping the Hydra branch up in this <a href="https://github.com/Modulo-P/hydra-node-plutusv3" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">example repository</a>.</p>

<p>SundaeLabs is working on a Hydra-based layer two protocol (<code>gummiworm</code>) that requires the usage of <code>hydra-node</code> components in a different way than the default setup. As part of this development, SundaeLabs submitted a Fund10 Catalyst proposal to enhance the Hydra node by adding features that would facilitate not only their work but also the work of everyone building on Hydra.</p>
<p>They have been working on a plugin architecture to enable the infiltration and exfiltration of events, which enables hygienic forks of Hydra that feature additional connections to the outside world. They are interested in consuming the Hydra event stream via Amazon Kinesis and storing transaction archives on S3 for later reference.</p>
<p>After an initial design phase resulting in <a href="https://hydra.family/head-protocol/adr/29/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ADR29</a>, they contributed the event source and sink abstractions, and refactored the Hydra node to use these new extension points together with core contributors. The <code>EventSource</code> and <code>EventSink</code> interfaces, along with the configurable list of <code>eventSinks</code> in the main <code>HydraNode</code> handle, allow to extend the <code>hydra-node</code> with any external system. It also paves the way for more scalable persistence methods on the mainline Hydra node, and might even allow refactoring the existing API server as an <code>EventSink</code>.</p>

<p>This month, the Hydra team has been asked to provide a walkthrough of how we use GitHub to run and govern the project. We have prepared a video that explains how we use Github issues, pull requests, discussions, and projects to manage the development of the Hydra project. However, it is important to note that this information represents only a current view and we are enthusiastic about continuously improving the processes to make them more transparent.</p>

<p>We are excited to announce that we are looking to establish a Hydra working group at Intersect. This group will aim to involve more community members in proposing feature backlogs, roadmaps, and RFPs. Initially, the focus of this working group will be on the concrete Hydra Head protocol (state channels). However, variations such as Hydrozoa, and combined scalability protocols like Gummiworm, Lightning-like payment channel networks, or the Hydra Tail protocol (~ rollups) will also require more community involvement. Stay tuned for more updates on this in the upcoming months.</p>

<p>We held the monthly review meeting for March 2024 on 2024-03-27 via Google Meet,
presenting these <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1pxV7VTDHW-wtvJy1RDuei7H14gQvgrrUlqoiOco6j9E" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">slides</a> and this <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1SL5Js8wBIoBeb87exCmZTWtHSQy7xF1W/view" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">recording</a>.</p>
<p>This month we have made significant progress on Mithril transaction signatures, while the Hydra team has been busy working on the incremental commits/decommits features. Both projects are fully prepared for the upcoming Conway hard fork on Cardano and continuously demonstrate user experience improvements.</p>
<p>Besides the Hydra explorer user interface, the teams also showcased the Mithril transaction verification feature in the Mithril explorer frontend. This demonstrates that Cardano transactions can be additionally verified using Mithril certificates from within a web browser. Taking this even further, we believe that such a "Verified with Mithril" checkmark can provide additional level of confirmation for users of light wallets and Cardano DApps!</p>
<p>Besides these, Modulo-P showcased their early adoption of Hydra heads using <code>Conway</code> and <code>PlutusV3</code> for their quite involved zero-knowledge protocols. Briefly after the meeting they released a first look on their <a href="https://zkmastermind.modulo-p.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">zkMastermind DApp</a>. Also, SundaeLabs presented their streaming plugins for Hydra. Both are examples of how the Hydra protocol can be extended and used in different ways, and we are excited to see more community contributions in the future.</p>
<p>As a closing remark, we see the trend of decentralizing governance on both projects, Hydra and Mithril, while at large the overall 'age of Voltaire' is unfolding. Consequently, we anticipate moves, merges, or restructuring of repositories, projects, and working groups. What an exciting time to be a part of this big Cardano community!</p>]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This is the first joint report of the üê≤ Hydra and üõ° Mithril projects, which summarizes the teams' progress since January 2024.</p>
<p>Previously, both teams had been releasing progress updates in different formats and intervals within their respective repositories:</p>
<ul>
<li>Hydra <a href="https://cardano-scaling.org/monthly">monthly reports</a></li>
<li>Mithril <a href="https://mithril.network/doc/dev-blog/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">dev blog</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Both sites are created from the individual project repositories. However, it is not ideal to keep 'procedural' documents as part of the code base, since it requires special handling when building versioned, published documentation. For example, <a href="https://github.com/input-output-hk/hydra/blob/fad12fd7d967e5e8af4d8b832396e68bd8510e9a/.github/workflows/publish-docs.yaml#L87-L92" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this workflow</a> in the Hydra project which publishes to <a href="https://hydra.family/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://hydra.family</a> required several attempts to work around how Docusaurus websites are built. Consequently, we introduced a <a href="https://github.com/cardano-scaling/website" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">dedicated repository</a> that builds into a <a href="https://cardano-scaling.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">website</a>. This not only helps keep the original product repositories clean of inherently dated information, but also serves as a new home for joint reports, announcements, or occasional articles.</p>
<p>This monthly report serves as preparation for the monthly stakeholder review meeting (see <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/18buDs_TcMHgFAYjJt9GftQiEnVB3ubcoD3Djh3ovxSc/edit#slide=id.g1f87a7454a5_0_1392" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">slides</a> and <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1WZ03vcpfxgYhGw91-L3QXVfyNwhdaCBY/view" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">recording</a>). At the meeting, the teams update stakeholders on recent developments and gather feedback on proposed plans.</p>

<p>The team has been working on implementing a proof of concept of a new data type that will enable the certification of Cardano transactions within Mithril networks. Last month, the team extended the <a href="https://crates.io/crates/mithril-client" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Mithril client library</a> to support the certification of Cardano transactions. This month, the team have upgraded the <a href="https://mithril.network/doc/manual/developer-docs/nodes/mithril-client/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">client CLI</a> and introduced a new <code>cardano-transaction</code> command that can list snapshots and certify a list of Cardano transactions. Additionally, they have implemented the same API surface on the <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/@mithril-dev/mithril-client-wasm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">WASM client</a> that now supports transaction certification in the browser.</p>

<p>The team has conducted thorough testing on the upcoming Conway era and are confident that Mithril networks will transition smoothly to this new era.

<p>This month, the Hydra project <a href="https://github.com/orgs/input-output-hk/projects/21/views/7" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">roadmap</a> underwent a few changes:</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" alt="The roadmap with features and ideas" src="https://cardano-scaling.org/assets/images/2024-02-hydra-roadmap-ac47b5ab937793764b6a7a35508db223.jpg" width="1165" height="857" class="img_ev3q"> <small></small></p><center><small>The latest roadmap with features and ideas</small></center><p></p>

<ul>
<li>New: <a href="https://github.com/input-output-hk/hydra/issues/1213" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Drop support for JSON encoded transactions #1213</a> due to breaking changes when upgrading <code>cardano-node</code> and <code>cardano-ledger</code> versions.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/input-output-hk/hydra/issues/1257" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Smoke tests on SanchoNet #1257</a> took longer than expected, revealing issues, but seeing smoke tests run on SanchoNet makes the team confident the <code>hydra-node</code> is ready for the Conway hard fork</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/input-output-hk/hydra/issues/696" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Build and deploy a Hydra heads explorer #696</a> is around 50% complete. Data is available for <code>sanchonet</code> at <a href="http://explorer.hydra.family/heads" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">http://explorer.hydra.family/heads</a> but a user interface is still needed.</li>

<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="contest-after-fanout-bug-hunt">Contest after fanout bug hunt<a href="https://cardano-scaling.org/monthly/2024-02#contest-after-fanout-bug-hunt" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Contest after fanout bug hunt" title="Direct link to Contest after fanout bug hunt">‚Äã</a></h3>
<p>While working on <a href="https://github.com/abailly-iohk/hydra-chess" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">hydra-chess</a>, the team encountered a <a href="https://github.com/input-output-hk/hydra/issues/1260" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">bug</a> in the Hydra node. In the two-party Hydra Head, nobody was able to perform a <code>Fanout</code>. This happened because one of the nodes was in the initial <code>Snapshot</code> state and missed the request for a new <code>Snapshot</code>, while the other node already had one confirmed <code>Snapshot</code> locally.</p>
<p>When the <code>Close</code> was posted, the Head was closed with the initial <code>Snapshot</code> and then contested by the node that saw a newer <code>Snapshot</code>. After the contest, the team observed a strange behavior where both nodes could not <code>Fanout</code>. We expected this failure in the node that only had the initial <code>Snapshot</code> since it did not have the correct <code>UTxO</code> locally to <code>Fanout</code>. However, the failure in the other node with the newer <code>Snapshot</code> should not have happened.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" alt="Fanout after contest bug sketching" src="https://cardano-scaling.org/assets/images/2024-02-fanout-after-contest-e156eac8175aaf0c1cfc5cce266d50d3.png" width="1473" height="871" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<p>While reviewing the code, the team discovered that the <code>Contest</code> observation was not extending the deadline after the contestation was made. As a result, the <code>Fanout</code> transaction was invalid because the validator checks that the <code>Fanout</code> transaction's lower validity bound is higher than the deadline to contest. This check ensures that one can only fan out after the contestation period is over.</p>
<p>Before fixing this bug, the team tried reproducing it using the MBT (Model Based Tests) framework, one of the tools in the test suite. However, to do that, they needed to complete modeling the entire head lifecycle and the specific scenario they observed in real life and arbitrary actions in all head states did not reveal this bug.</p>
<p>After also improving the framework itself to correctly validate transactions and a fix for simulating rollbacks, the team was able to fix the bug easily. However, it proves that being able to reproduce a bug is not only improving the code, but also allowed the team to gain knowledge and improve their test suites.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="hydra-explorer-supporting-multiple-versions">Hydra explorer supporting multiple versions<a href="https://cardano-scaling.org/monthly/2024-02#hydra-explorer-supporting-multiple-versions" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Hydra explorer supporting multiple versions" title="Direct link to Hydra explorer supporting multiple versions">‚Äã</a></h3>
<p>This month, the team deployed the <code>hydra-explorer</code> to serve data under <a href="http://explorer.hydra.family/heads" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">http://explorer.hydra.family/heads</a>. Alongside this, they upgraded the Hydra scripts and switched to the latest pre-release version of <code>cardano-node</code> for Conway, and the system is currently running on the <code>sanchonet</code> network.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://cardano-scaling.org/assets/images/2024-02-explorer-c62da5d26af0f2e492d8599f0622b6be.png" width="750" height="542" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<p>The Hydra explorer currently has the capability to support only one version on a single network. The reason for this limitation is that the Hydra scripts are compiled into two binaries- <code>hydra-node</code> and <code>hydra-chain-observer</code> - and the observer is connected to a single <code>cardano-node</code> that operates as a client on one network.</p>
<p>To support multiple versions of the protocol <a href="https://github.com/input-output-hk/hydra/issues/1282" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">#1282</a>, the team needs to compile the scripts of each version into individual chain observer binaries. These binaries can then communicate with the <code>hydra-explorer</code> components through an API. While Plutus validators change with any modification (thus affecting their hashes and addresses), this API can serve as an integration point that the team can support through multiple versions of the protocol.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="community">Community<a href="https://cardano-scaling.org/monthly/2024-02#community" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Community" title="Direct link to Community">‚Äã</a></h2>
<p>Both projects saw community contributions this month:</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="txpipe-on-mithril">TxPipe on Mithril<a href="https://cardano-scaling.org/monthly/2024-02#txpipe-on-mithril" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to TxPipe on Mithril" title="Direct link to TxPipe on Mithril">‚Äã</a></h3>
<p>The TxPipe team has kept working on the implementation of the <code>Pallas Chain Observer</code> for Mithril nodes and has contributed to retrieving the stake distribution and Mithril era markers (stored in the UTxOs of the chain) directly from the Cardano node with mini-protocols.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="ikigai-auctions-on-hydra">Ikigai auctions on Hydra<a href="https://cardano-scaling.org/monthly/2024-02#ikigai-auctions-on-hydra" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Ikigai auctions on Hydra" title="Direct link to Ikigai auctions on Hydra">‚Äã</a></h3>
<p>As it also was briefly shown in the review meeting, Ikigai continued work on <a href="https://cardano-scaling.org/monthly/2023-06#hydra-for-auctions-contributions-and-closing-of-project">Hydra for Auctions</a> in their Catalyst-backed project. Their use case is about starting auctions on the Cardano mainnet, but then collecting bids off-chain and only committing the final result on-chain. This is a perfect use case for Hydra, as it allows for a large number of off-chain transactions to be processed in parallel and then committed to the blockchain in a single transaction.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="conclusion">Conclusion<a href="https://cardano-scaling.org/monthly/2024-02#conclusion" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Conclusion" title="Direct link to Conclusion">‚Äã</a></h2>
<p>We held the monthly review meeting for February 2024 on 2024-02-26 via Google Meet, presenting these <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/18buDs_TcMHgFAYjJt9GftQiEnVB3ubcoD3Djh3ovxSc/edit#slide=id.g1f87a7454a5_0_1392" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">slides</a> and this <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1WZ03vcpfxgYhGw91-L3QXVfyNwhdaCBY/view" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">recording</a>.</p>
<p>This month, both projects focused on preparing for Conway and the upcoming hard fork combinator event. Preparations for the hard fork made the <code>cardano-node</code> a moving target, but the teams believe that early integration is key. Unexpected issues popped up in both projects, but they were able to address them.</p>
<p>New feature development is progressing well, with Mithril's transaction signing now available to early adopters. This feature opens up the possibility of making <code>hydra-node</code>s more lightweight, as they won't need to rely on a single third party for trusted chain data. Instead, they can verify on the client (the Hydra node) using Mithril certificates. Additionally, Hydra's incremental decommit feature is in progress. While there's still significant work to be done on the on-chain parts, the teams have already implemented the off-chain workflow for incremental commits. Making both features available for users to try out will help validate the API changes. However, this cannot be released to mainnet without completing the required on-chain security work. During the review meeting, the teams sought feedback on a potential simplification of the Hydra on-chain protocol to have 'directly open' heads. Any thoughts or feedback on this fresh <a href="https://github.com/input-output-hk/hydra/issues/1329" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">feature idea
#1329</a> would be appreciated.</p>
<p>In general, if you read this far we would like to hear from you, dear reader, on any of our communication channels on Discord or a shout out on twitter. Maybe along with some feedback on the new, common website and the joint monthly report format? üôè</p>
<p>We are looking forward to the next month and when it happens, the Conway hard-fork on the first public testnets (no date yet) when üõ° Mithril serving certificates and üê≤ Hydra heads remaining open throughout.</p>]]></content>

<p>This month, the team worked on the following:</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="api-changes-dropping-json-tx">API changes: dropping JSON Tx<a href="https://cardano-scaling.org/monthly/2024-01#api-changes-dropping-json-tx" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to API changes: dropping JSON Tx" title="Direct link to API changes: dropping JSON Tx">‚Äã</a></h3>
<p>The Hydra API now utilizes a TextEnvelope containing the upstream CBOR encoding from <code>cardano-api</code> for the <code>Tx</code> type and removes the JSON representation from the API <a href="https://github.com/input-output-hk/hydra/pull/1240" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">#1240</a>. This ensures that transaction types have a fixed canonical encoding that will not change between versions. As a result, consumers of the Hydra API will need to deserialize CBOR to inspect transactions.</p>
<p>This representation mirrors the TextEnvelope produced by the <code>cardano-cli</code>, with the addition of an <code>txId</code> field, which is guaranteed to match the transaction ID within the CBOR object.</p>

<p>We team began developing a game on Hydra, leveraging dogfooding to uncover suboptimal elements or stumble upon bugs requiring resolution. Hydra Chess exemplified this process, offering valuable lessons during DApp development.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://red-permanent-barnacle-730.mypinata.cloud/ipfs/bafybeicxcm4yuedetm45kn6xrzqsc4mn2aocmhqtt6wrwxz5lzfry722ra/hydra-chess.png" alt="" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<p>While refining the details, the team aims to improve the workflow of running <code>hydra-node</code> within a full peer-to-peer DApp framework. The objective is to ensure user-friendly accessibility while also providing an example for Hydra developers. You can access the source code <a href="https://github.com/abailly-iohk/hydra-chess" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>.</p>

<p>To measure the progress and success of Hydra, we require tools that provide insights into its usage. For this, the team initiated work on <a href="https://github.com/input-output-hk/hydra/issues/696" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">#696</a>, enabling anyone to track Hydra heads throughout their entire life cycle and observe the growth of the Hydra ecosystem.</p>
<p>In this initial phase, the team has implemented a basic backend service <a href="https://github.com/input-output-hk/hydra/pull/1235" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">#1235</a> that can track all heads on-chain within a devnet network. This service establishes a baseline and utilizes the <code>hydra-chain-observer</code> package, exposing a REST API for querying and retrieving information about all observed heads and their current states.</p>

<p>TapTools recently published a summary of the project's progress over the last two months, which complements the updates provided above. Check it out <a href="https://medium.com/tap-in-with-taptools/input-output-releases-hydra-update-97b6139d1c59" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>!</p>
<p>Besides the contributed offline mode mentioned above, Sundae Labs is also implementing a streaming API as designed in <a href="https://hydra.family/head-protocol/adr/29/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ADR29</a> in the course of <a href="https://milestones.projectcatalyst.io/projects/1000180" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this Catalyst project</a>.</p>
<p>Also <a href="https://milestones.projectcatalyst.io/projects/1000092" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">funded through Catalyst</a> is a continuation of the <a href="https://github.com/mlabs-haskell/hydra-auction" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Hydra auction</a> project by Ikigai and MLabs. The Hydra team has not yet re-engaged in a regular exchange, but they expect to support the project with features as needed as they kick off this work.</p>
<p>As also pointed out in the review session, some of the team members have been involved in organizing the first <a href="https://buidl.2024.cardano.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Cardano Buidler Fest</a> - happening on April 23-24 in Toulouse, France. This event will be a prime chance to connect with the people building (on) Cardano and inspire new ways of collaboration. At the time of publishing, tickets are already sold out, but we hope to see many Cardano builders there!</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="conclusion">Conclusion<a href="https://cardano-scaling.org/monthly/2024-01#conclusion" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Conclusion" title="Direct link to Conclusion">‚Äã</a></h2>
<p>We held the monthly review meeting for January 2024 on 2024-01-19 via Google Meet, presenting these <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/113okna4iyhgC7ERDLVHxqQkvhqTUSWJUWjXfkpwIpEY" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">slides</a> and this <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1XnM4RMKSiJNKLs2GBEg32ZHymg-fGBFt" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">recording</a>.</p>
<p>This month, the teams demonstrated various Hydra and Mithril features. Additionally, Juan Mag√°n and his team from Modulo-P showcased a compelling demo on utilizing zero-knowledge cryptography in a Hydra head for a mastermind game. This work is a Catalyst Fund 10 <a href="https://cardano.ideascale.com/c/idea/113249" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">accepted proposal</a>.</p>
<p>Besides providing the usual status and roadmap updates on both Hydra and Mithril, several interested community members, including Tudor, joined the discussion to share their use case ideas. Tudor presented his proposal for supply chain tracking of Moldavian wine, which is currently running as a Catalyst proposal in Fund11. The proposal aims to leverage Hydra for CIP-68 NFT updates in a head, requiring wallet/app support. We also discussed a potential CIP to standardize asset access if held on layer 2 ledgers.</p>
<p>Charles provided feedback on considering Cardano block extensions as a potential core protocol change, enabling various proof systems and new consensus algorithms to support partner chains. We further emphasized collaborative efforts with the community to explore and develop the user space, determining which aspects could evolve into marketplaces and what should be integrated into core protocols. Processes like CIPs play a vital role in standardizing and facilitating technology transfer from the 'user space' to the 'kernel space'.</p>
<p>These discussions will inform the team's roadmapping sessions for the year, focusing not only on building essential features for the Hydra Head protocol but also on experimenting with new approaches to enhance Cardano's efficiency and accessibility.</p>]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This report summarizes the work on Hydra since October 2023. It serves as
preparation for the monthly review meeting (see <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1JA_frlOXVrrBeaBGUnIq3U9cclrfU1A2cZR9B2AeVJg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">slides</a> and

<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="roadmap">Roadmap<a href="https://cardano-scaling.org/monthly/2023-11#roadmap" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Roadmap" title="Direct link to Roadmap">‚Äã</a></h2>
<p>This month, several items were restructured on the project
<a href="https://github.com/orgs/input-output-hk/projects/21/views/7" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">roadmap</a>:</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" alt="The roadmap with features and ideas" src="https://cardano-scaling.org/assets/images/2023-11-roadmap-4d71f2e1c5303a1ecbc4311421f8d889.jpg" width="10064" height="4868" class="img_ev3q"> <small></small></p><center><small>The latest roadmap with features and ideas</small></center><p></p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Release of version <code>0.14.0</code> is imminent as most of the <a href="https://github.com/input-output-hk/hydra/issues/1096" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">stateless chain
observation #1096</a>
feature is done and only some internal refactoring missing.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The user-submitted feature idea on supporting extended keys,
<a href="https://github.com/input-output-hk/hydra/issues/1141" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">#1141</a>, has
been refined. The purpose of this item is now clear, and although
it's not currently a priority, work on it can be started.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Two new items were created to improve the developer experience of the <a href="https://github.com/input-output-hk/hydra/issues/1146" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Hydra build
toolchain #1146</a>. Additionally, a
follow-up on things learned by <code>hydra-poll</code> aims to create a full end-to-end
example of a <a href="https://github.com/input-output-hk/hydra/issues/1098" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">two-player game in a Hydra head
#1098</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There was already an item about reacting to main chain parameter changes on the
roadmap, which included not only protocol parameter updates, but also
hard-fork events. With the upcoming hard fork into <code>Conway</code>, the team split off the
changes needed to navigate the hard fork and clarified them:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/input-output-hk/hydra/issues/1177" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Conway support #1177</a> will make the <code>hydra-node</code> support Conway and allow users to keep heads open across the hard fork.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/input-output-hk/hydra/issues/1178" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Drop Babbage support #1178</a> will eventually drop support for the Babbage era and retain maintainability.</li>
<li>The original item is only about <a href="https://github.com/input-output-hk/hydra/issues/195" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">reacting to protocol parameter changes #195</a> now.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Substantial updates were made to the design of the next major feature <a href="https://github.com/input-output-hk/hydra/issues/1057" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Incremental decommit #1057</a>, and work on it can be started.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In general, the team prepared several of these üí≠ idea items and many of them will turn into üí¨ features soon.</p>
</li>

<p>This month, the team worked on the following:</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="meshjs--hydra">MeshJS + Hydra<a href="https://cardano-scaling.org/monthly/2023-11#meshjs--hydra" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to MeshJS + Hydra" title="Direct link to MeshJS + Hydra">‚Äã</a></h3>
<p>At the beginning of month, the team attended the Cardano Summit in Dubai where they held
the <em>Hydra MasterClass</em> workshop. There they also presented the Hydra-Poll dApp
which is using MeshJS to build Hydra transactions on the frontend.</p>
<p>The Hydra team collaborated closely with the MeshJS team and as the outcome of this work
The MeshJS team added some Hydra specific features to the MeshJS SDK. There is a nice low
level <a href="https://meshjs.dev/apis/transaction/builderExample" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">API</a> for building
custom transactions which is pretty similar to what <code>cardano-cli</code> does.</p>
<p>Now you can use <code>isHydra</code> field which you can pass to this API which then uses
another set of protocol parameters suitable for Hydra (eg. usually in Hydra we
want to have zero transaction fees, reduce script execution units etc.).</p>
<p>Big thanks to the MeshJS team on giving much needed support. They were
presenting these changes in the monthly review meeting so make sure to watch the
<a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1-iv8IveUzA2KrJV_Kqrgx4ts05Ow0zjM" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">recording</a>.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="rendering-the-hydra-specification">Rendering the Hydra specification<a href="https://cardano-scaling.org/monthly/2023-11#rendering-the-hydra-specification" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Rendering the Hydra specification" title="Direct link to Rendering the Hydra specification">‚Äã</a></h3>
<p>Besides working on the design of incremental commits itself, the team also
tidied up the way the <a href="https://hydra.family/head-protocol/core-concepts/specification" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Hydra protocol
specification</a>
is written.</p>
<p>So far, the specification was written in LaTex and rendered to a PDF. LaTeX was
a good choice because of its expressiveness on math expressions, but not so
great a choice for pull requests and the entry barrier is quite
high. The majority of documentation around Hydra and Mithril is written using
Markdown and rendered into a webpage using a static site generator, currently
<a href="https://docusaurus.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Docusaurus</a>. Most modern Markdown renderers do support
LaTeX-style math nowadays, even the normal <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/working-with-advanced-formatting/writing-mathematical-expressions" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GitHub file
preview</a>.</p>
<p>Hence, the team experimented with using the more standard Markdown format to write the
specification, but still being able to use LaTeX math <strong>and</strong> LaTeX macros
(which are <em>still</em> heavily used in the spec). The aim is to have both, a
PDF and HTML rendering.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://ipfs.io/ipfs/QmPUTYaSViLEyZcGmsTPL4jHdGSevH3yc3RD7TRhU3ivwH?filename=Peek%202023-11-28%2018-42.gif" alt="" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<p>While not yet finished, the GIF above shows the progress being made using
<a href="https://pandoc.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pandoc</a> to resolve macros, producing a PDF via <code>xelatex</code>
and Docusaurus compatible markdown. Using powerful extensions of pandoc one can
even convert TikZ, GraphViz and Mermaid into both target formats.</p>

<p>Beside the great work done by the MeshJS team towards supporting Hydra in the browser, here are some news and updates on community-led work streams related to Hydra:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>SundaeLabs has made good progress on their <a href="https://github.com/input-output-hk/hydra/pull/1118" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">offline mode
PR</a> which should
hit the main branch soon,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>TxPipe has been collaborating with IOG's creative engineering team
to build <em>Cardaminal</em>, a command-line wallet, and demonstrated it
during the monthly review meeting. Cardaminal is built in Rust,
leveraging <a href="https://github.com/txpipe/pallas" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pallas</a> libraries, and
is aimed at being a fully-fledged scriptable wallet providing users
with powerful stateful transaction edition capabilities, native
assets management, chain synchronisation, etc.</p>
<p>The plan is to make Cardaminal compatible with Hydra - to be able to
use it to interact with a head - and Mithril - using snapshots to
synchronise the wallet.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The team behind <a href="https://projectcatalyst.io/funds/10/f10-development-and-infrastructure/a-zero-knowledge-proof-framework-for-cardano-based-on-hydra-and-zk-snarks" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ZK Snarks in
Hydra</a>
Catalyst proposal is making good progress and should be able to give
a demo at the next monthly review meeting</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="conclusion">Conclusion<a href="https://cardano-scaling.org/monthly/2023-11#conclusion" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Conclusion" title="Direct link to Conclusion">‚Äã</a></h2>
<p>The monthly review meeting for November 2023 was held on 2023-11-27 via Google
Meet with these <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1JA_frlOXVrrBeaBGUnIq3U9cclrfU1A2cZR9B2AeVJg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">slides</a> and the <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1-iv8IveUzA2KrJV_Kqrgx4ts05Ow0zjM" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">recording</a>.</p>
<p>The Hydra team is thankful to have again had so many great demos from the numerous projects
in and around Hydra and Mithril projects - we should really schedule it to be one
hour planned duration. Also, if you have not watched it already, make sure to
check out the recording, the written report is merely expanding on a couple of
topics but cannot render the cool demonstrations.</p>
<p>At first look, the demonstrated projects may appear not related - we even had a
minimal command-line wallet on the show after all. But as we went on, these
impulses spark discussions and it becomes clear that all of these projects are
connected.</p>
<p>For example, the terminal-based wallet 'Cardaminal' as it was presented the
first time in public this month, could itself become a Mithril client for faster
synchronizing or even light-mode using the recently published Rust client
library for Mithril. Furthermore, such a minimal wallet would be a great testing
ground for a Hydra-aware wallet. The MeshJS integration also has further
potential of Hydra specific <code>fetcher</code> and <code>submitter</code> providers.</p>
<p>On the other hand, we also stumbled over not-so-optimistic sentiment even in
much more mature scaling solutions like the Bitcoin Lightning Network. <a href="https://twitter.com/udiWertheimer/status/1719122153155473492" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">This
tweet</a> summarizes
that creating non-custodial [scalability/LN] solutions 'feel like the most
thankless thing in the world'.</p>
<p>It is an exciting ride still, but events like this monthly review meeting with
its colorful demonstrations of small steps to improve the usability
and scalability of Cardano piece by piece with often unknown synergies is also
empowering. This month again made us feel not 'only a tribe', but more a working
group across the Cardano community .. the Cardano Scaling group!?</p>]]></content>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Moved the <a href="https://github.com/input-output-hk/hydra/issues/188" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">network resilience
#188</a> issue out of version 0.13.0 to
allow for a quick release of the security fixes. This feature has been split
in two parts, both of which are completed and will soon be included in the 0.14.0 release.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A new user submitted a feature idea about supporting extended keys <a href="https://github.com/input-output-hk/hydra/issues/1141" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">#1141</a>. Initially
urgent, it's no longer a priority and requires further clarification.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Although not part of Hydra version 0.14.0, the team completed the integration of <a href="https://github.com/input-output-hk/hydra/issues/1078" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Hydra
support in Kupo #1078</a>,
which can already be used with Kupo version
<a href="https://github.com/CardanoSolutions/kupo/releases/tag/v2.7" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">2.7.0</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Implemented a new <a href="https://github.com/input-output-hk/hydra/issues/1110" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Hydra Poll DApp</a>
feature, which is an example to be demonstrated at the Cardano Summit 2023.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Realized <a href="https://github.com/input-output-hk/hydra/issues/1096" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">stateless chain observation
#1096</a> as a dedicated
feature, which will add a <code>hydra-chain-observer</code> tool and simplify upcoming
feature implementation related to layer 1 transactions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Created a feature idea item to <a href="https://github.com/input-output-hk/hydra/issues/1092" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">migrate all validators to Aiken
#1092</a>. This was moved
to 1.0.0 though, as it would require a complete re-audit of the scripts and
and there is no urgent requirement for performance improvements at this stage.</p>

<p>This month, the team worked on the following:</p>
<h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="network-resilience-to-node-crash">Network resilience to node crash<a href="https://cardano-scaling.org/monthly/2023-10#network-resilience-to-node-crash" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Network resilience to node crash" title="Direct link to Network resilience to node crash">‚Äã</a></h4>
<p>Last month, the team worked on making the Hydra network resilient to
transient network connectivity failure (see
<a href="https://github.com/input-output-hk/hydra/issues/188" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">#188</a>). However, this
was just one aspect of the larger effort to improve the overall stability and
reliability of the network. By completing
<a href="https://github.com/input-output-hk/hydra/issues/1079" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">#1079</a>, the team also
made the network resilient to arbitrary node failures, which is a much
more likely event to happen should the network run for a significant
amount of time.</p>
<p>Hydra nodes now persist the network messages they <em>send</em> to peers and
together with the already present acknowledgment mechanism, this means
a node recovering from a crash can resend messages which were not
received by their peers.</p>
<h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="hydra-poll-dapp">Hydra Poll DApp<a href="https://cardano-scaling.org/monthly/2023-10#hydra-poll-dapp" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Hydra Poll DApp" title="Direct link to Hydra Poll DApp">‚Äã</a></h4>
<p>As the Hydra team seeks to adhere more to the principles of
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eating_your_own_dog_food" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">dogfooding</a>,
we wanted to upgrade our basic Hydraw application to something more
interactive. We, therefore, built a <a href="https://github.com/input-output-hk/hydra/issues/1110" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">poll
DApp</a> with the
goal of demonstrating how one can build an application living entirely
in the frontend that can interact directly with a hydra-node, using
its websockets-based API. This application was also showcased at the
<a href="https://summit.cardano.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Cardano Summit 2023</a>, where the Hydra
team delivered a masterclass.</p>
<h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="upgrade-to-ghc-96--brick-110">Upgrade to GHC 9.6 &amp; Brick 1.10<a href="https://cardano-scaling.org/monthly/2023-10#upgrade-to-ghc-96--brick-110" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Upgrade to GHC 9.6 &amp; Brick 1.10" title="Direct link to Upgrade to GHC 9.6 &amp; Brick 1.10">‚Äã</a></h4>
<p>This month, we were able to update our compiler toolchain from GHC 9.2.8 to
9.6.3. This also required us to upgrade the hydra-tui from Brick 0.73 to 1.10
to stay compatible with the new version of the mtl.</p>
<p>The update to Brick necessitated a complete rewrite of the hydra-tui which
greatly simplifies the application logic, using Brick's new elm architecture
style combined with microlens-mtl.</p>

<p>This month, the monthly review meeting was almost completely covered by
demonstrations from the various teams working on and with Hydra. Don't miss out

<p>Hypix is a continuation of the 'Hydraw' demonstration the team used throughout
development. The project is spear-headed by Trym Bruset and will integrate CIP-68
NFTs with instant transaction processing in a Hydra head to realize
collaboratively created art pieces. The project is progressing great with an
open beta available soon.</p>

<p>Indexers of chain data, like <a href="https://github.com/CardanoSolutions/kupo" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Kupo</a>,
are useful to enable lightweight decentralized applications like Hypix. As the
application state of Hypix, for example, is not only on the Cardano layer 1, but
also in the Hydra head, Kupo was enhanced to run 'in front of' a <code>hydra-node</code> and
provide the same API for UTXOs indexed from a Hydra head. This was a <a href="https://github.com/CardanoSolutions/kupo/pull/117" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">joint
effort</a> between
<a href="https://github.com/KtorZ" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">@KtorZ</a>, <a href="https://github.com/v0d1ch" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">@v0d1ch</a> and
<a href="https://github.com/ch1bo" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">@ch1bo</a> and has been <a href="https://github.com/CardanoSolutions/kupo/releases/tag/v2.7" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">released in version 2.7 of
Kupo</a>.</p>

<p><a href="https://projectcatalyst.io/funds/10/f10-development-and-infrastructure/sundae-labs-hydra-ledger-only-mode" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ledger-only
mode</a>
for Hydra was one of the Catalyst Fund10 projects that got funded and
work is underway to make it an integral part of Hydra software
components. A <a href="https://hydra.family/head-protocol/unstable/adr/28.%20Offline%20mode" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">new
ADR</a>
has been proposed which details the rationale behind this new feature
and an overview of what it brings and what impacts it will have on the
hydra-node.</p>
<p>Moreover, this implementation is
<a href="https://github.com/input-output-hk/hydra/pull/1118" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">underway</a> and
should be part of the next release. This will enable running a single
hydra-node as a kind of 'ledger-as-a-service', priming it with some
UTXOs and allowing clients to submit and validate transactions without
any relationship to layer 1.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="voting-on-hydra">Voting on Hydra<a href="https://cardano-scaling.org/monthly/2023-10#voting-on-hydra" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Voting on Hydra" title="Direct link to Voting on Hydra">‚Äã</a></h3>
<p>The
<a href="https://github.com/cardano-foundation/hydra-voting-poc" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Hydra-for-voting</a>
project has been started earlier this year as a proof-of-concept to
explore how a Hydra Head could help improve the voting or rather
tallying process for Catalyst and other large-scale on-chain
decision-making process. It's been on pause for a few months due to
other priorities but it's been revived recently and put to use to
tally votes for the Cardano Summit's awards recipients.</p>
<p>This development effort led to a couple of new features and fixes:</p>
<ul>
<li>The ability to <a href="https://github.com/input-output-hk/hydra/issues/1111" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">submit
a transaction</a>
for layer 1 using 'standard' CBOR-hex format</li>
<li>Upgrade to the checked-in <a href="https://github.com/input-output-hk/hydra/issues/1117" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">protocol
parameters</a>
used by demo network which were out of sync with the internal ledger
version</li>
<li>Discussion on the usage of <a href="https://github.com/input-output-hk/hydra/issues/1141" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">extended payment
keys</a> in
in relation to the Hydra Head protocol</li>
</ul>

<p>The team has initiated discussions with another funded Catalyst Fund10
project, exploring the implementation of a <a href="https://projectcatalyst.io/funds/10/f10-development-and-infrastructure/a-zero-knowledge-proof-framework-for-cardano-based-on-hydra-and-zk-snarks" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">zero-knowledge proof system</a>
for Cardano, utilizing Hydra and ZK Snarks. At this early stage, there
is minimal progress to display, but the team is eager to start the
development of this promising tool.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="conclusion">Conclusion<a href="https://cardano-scaling.org/monthly/2023-10#conclusion" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Conclusion" title="Direct link to Conclusion">‚Äã</a></h2>
<p>The monthly review meeting for October 2023 was held on 2023-10-30 via Google
Meet with these <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1pJMRp0YsszJenUvDmknm3wq9yyUE1CDRSYijjILrkHo" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">slides</a> and the <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1U4yZhliGykxF3BddAAXb4RD417UvsQWB" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">recording</a>.</p>
<p>As mentioned above, the meeting was about 45 minutes of demonstrations - which
clearly shows that we are in the wake of Catalyst Fund10 where several project
proposals involving Hydra and Mithril got funded and at the same time everyone
was preparing for the Cardano Summit 2023.</p>
<p>With this many community contributions and projects moving forward, there was
not much time to discuss the Hydra roadmap or go into details about Mithril
project status. This is great!</p>
<p>Besides, the project roadmaps seem to be well aligned where our next features
in-line are most anticipated (incremental de-/commits) and the adoption of Mithril
is showing a healthy level with clear next steps and features ahead.</p>
<p>It is getting increasingly hard to keep track of all the new developments around
Hydra. However, that is also often not needed and the Cardano builders just set
off and <a href="https://twitter.com/AltiMario/status/1711738372320825827?s=20" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">build
things</a> using
Hydra these days.</p>
<p>November will start with the Cardano Summit, likely yielding even more feedback
and feature ideas from users. Following this, there will be several productive weeks
focused on feature development before the usual Christmas and New Year breaks across the teams.</p>]]></content>
